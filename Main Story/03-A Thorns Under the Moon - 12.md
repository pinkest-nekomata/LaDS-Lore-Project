# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Zayne]] emerge safely from the [[Protofield]]. With the [[Wanderer]] defeated, [[MC]] is left with a green-tinged [[Protocore fragment]] from the suspicious [[Aether Core]] in her hand. ((This is later revealed to be a piece of the [[Spatium Core]].))

After heading back to [[Linkon]], [[Zayne]] is finally able to sleep. [[Simone]] calls [[MC]] and reveals that a strange device found in the ICU is a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]], which is able to summon [[Wanderer]]s. [[MC]] suspects [[Carter]] instantly, but [[Simone]] points out that [[Ever]] acquired [[Xander Sciences]] recently, after [[Raymond]]'s death.

MC puts this together with the [[human-like Wanderer]]s she saw in the [[N109 Zone]] to determine that Ever is creating monsters.

Though Zayne's dreams are initially pleasant, the dreaded nightmare of his ice hurting her returns.

## Commentary

### Freezing over Akso hospital
This use of [[Zayne]] and [[MC]]'s resonance to cover [[Akso Hospital]] in ice to drive out the [[Wanderer]] potentially mirrors/foreshadows the freezing of [[Akso Hospital]] mentioned in [[Zayne's Trailer]]. It's not yet clear whether the freezing of Akso Hospital's "original location" has already happened or is going to happen from the perspective of the main story timeline. ((Given that Zayne says he hopes they don't meet again, tonally it would be more appropriate for this to be before they meet and get close.))
# Details

> *Once the final blow is dealt to the [[Wanderer]], an intense tremor surges from the depths of my heart. But the resonance is unmistakable this time. It's akin to gentle waves brimming with power.
> A light, warm glow gently descends into my palm.*

MC emerges back into [[Chansia Hospital]].
> *The breaking dawn's light streams in through the window. In the silent corridor, the air carries a faint scent of disinfectant.*

Zayne is there with her, and he takes her hand. She messes with him a bit to confirm they're back in reality, then is suddenly unsteady on her feet--and realizes she's holding a green [[Protocore fragment]].

[[Greyson]] and [[Captain Willow]] spot them and hurry over, revealing it's been three day since they disappeared into the [[Protofield]]. The patient is now stable and fine. [[Captain Willow]] and the hunters discovered a strange device in the ICU, hidden in a [[Flux Stablizer]]. It must have been put there recently. 

Another three days later, MC is visiting Zayne's home in [[Linkon]] City. She finds him on the couch, finally sleeping peacefully, and covers him with a blanket.

Simone calls, revealing that the strange device is a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]], which can locate [[Protocore]]s or even attract [[Wanderer]]s. MC immediately suspects [[Carter]], but [[Simone]] thinks this device is way beyond both him and [[Xander Sciences]] in general--this is advanced [[Protocore]] tech, not a medical device. Simone goes on to say that [[Xander Sciences]] was acquired by [[Ever]] after its founder, [[Raymond]] died recently.

MC puts the clues together to determine that "[[Ever]] is creating monsters."

The scene shifts to a sunny street.
> *Once again, Zayne finds himself chasing after that familiar figure.*
> *Under radiant sunlight, cicadas chirp in the background while the pristine azure sky stretches as far as the eye can see. The sun sits on the edge of the city's high-rise buildings.*
> *The girl turns to him. She smiles. At least he caught up to her.*
> Zayne: Finally...
> *He holds his hand to the girl, and she firmly grasps it.*
> `The scene changes back to the dim hospital hallway.`
> *Yet the two find themselves tumbling back into the seemingly endless empty corridor.
> Black crystals emerge from his palm. They encroach on the girls' forearm. Sunlight is engulfed by darkness once more.*
* ((Usually, Dawnbreaker's dreams are the warm, sunny ones and Dr. Zayne's are the nightmares. Here, the two dreams blur, indicating that perhaps Dr. Zayne and Dawnbreaker are blurring as well.))
