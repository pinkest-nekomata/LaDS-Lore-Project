# Summary
Slowly, [[Sorceress MC]] loses track of who she is. Sometimes, she's the human chained in the courtyard. Other times, she's the dragon hiding out in the [[black chapel]]. The dragon is going mad. One time, she comes to her senses and finds herself biting one of the guards.

It's time for her judgement. The [[Sacred Judicator]] brings her to the court above the planet and sentences her to death. [[Arbiterwings]] circle overhead and lighting rains down. ((This is [[Heavenly Tribulation]], a punishment for going against Fate, and a trial for her to overcome.))

In what she believes to be her last moments, she remembers her dragon. She decides to finish the song for him. She sings the [[requiem]], and at the final note, the dragon appears. Soon, she is the last one alive.

She accepts that her fate is to die by her dragon's hand, and she reaches out for one last embrace. But instead, she sees his human form, and he pulls her hand to his chest and resonates with her. He's able to pull her power into materializing the sword--and plunging it through his own chest.

He urges her to press on--if she doesn't, Fate will take both of them to the Abyss for eternity. With the last of his strength, he carries her down to the valley. (This is the same moment that starts Chapter 8.) She watches him die, finally learning the truth of his childhood from his soul--the dragons weren't bothering anyone and were hunted down. The Doomsday, all the Fiend's supposed crimes--they were fabricated.

His defiance of fate, his death so she can live, is like a sword in her own chest. She curses him with immortality--so that she might be the only one who can grant him a true death.

In so doing, she fully embraces her nature--and finally becomes a dragon. But only after her beloved is gone.
## Commentary

# Details

> On that dew-drenched midsummer night, time seemed to freeze in place.
> Every thought of the future remained sweet and light.
> After giving up half my soul, the greatsword never appeared again. Perhaps I lost the power to wield it, no longer able to slay the dragon.
> Does that mean the dragon's curse has been broken? All I can do is look toward Tarus City.
> But as time goes on, the half of the dragon's soul within me burns more fiercely, a fervent desire like his searing my mind.
> With the ever-changing days and nights, I start to forget who I am.
> Sometimes, I'm the dragon hiding alone in the [[black chapel]]. Other times, I'm a human awaiting judgement in the Sanctuary's courtyard.
> When I came to my senses one time, I found myself sinking my teeth into the neck of a soldier who was guarding me.
> The courtyard grows quieter by the day, perhaps because there are fewer people left in the [[Ivory City]].
> The planet is in rapid decline. Before leaving, the last soldier tells me that the dragon has broken free form their restraints. He's gone completely mad and has nearly destroyed every city.
> The end of the world will be upon us. Soon, this ruined planet will only have the rampaging dragon left. I haven't seen Sylus until--
> The Doomsday Judgement arrives. They take me to the highest Court of Justitia on Philos.
> The court of Justitia hangs high in the sky. Under swirling red clouds, several [[Arbiterwings]] symbolizing divine retribution stay silent as they circle above.
> Amidst the ranks of the [[Legion of Justitia]], the [[Sacred Judicator]], wearing magnificent robes, stands on the looming platform like a lifeless statue.
> An ancient voice reverberates across the planet, enumerating the crimes the dragon and I have wrought upon the world, the reason why this grand execution is being held in the first place.


> [[Sacred Judicator]]: First crime: worshipping evil and desire, showing no repentance, letting your heart fall to corruption... Second crime: consorting with a Fiend and bearing its mark, tainting your very body with corruption... Third crime: plundering wealth and embracing insatiable greed, actions steeped in corruption...
> *Chains bind me at the center. Beyond the rattling of chains as I struggle, I hear nothing. Blood surges into my head, a restless fury rising in me, dragon-like and fierce.*
> Sacred Judicator: You are guilty on all fifteen counts, Sorceress. You shall be executed as a result. And it will be done immediately.
> *With a shrill cry from the [[Arbiterwings]], a bolt of lightning strikes my soul.*
* ((See also, [[Heavenly Tribulation]]))
> *Struggling to keep me upright, my knees buckle under the weight. But before I can stand again, another bolt of lightning rips through my mind and tears apart my senses.
> With my face pressed against the cold floor, I recall the image of the dragon plummeting into the alley, his chest pierced by a sword.*
* ((References the flashbacks to Sylus's first imprisonment in [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 3]]))
> MC: (Sylus...)
> *I remember the dragon who likes that [[requiem]]. But I've never sung it to him in full.*
> MC: (This is the first time... and the last time.)
> *It's like I'm back in Tarus City at night as I sit atop the dragon's lair. He sits beside me and says, "Sing it again."
> Tiny notes squeeze their way out of my chest. They gradually forge the fragments of an unfinished melody.*
> MC: (If you can't hear this now... Someone might never sing for you ever again...)
> *Soul-piercing lightning repeatedly interrupts my song. But I keep singing, unaware that all other sounds have faded away. The entire Court of Justitia falls into complete silence. Only the sorrowful [[requiem]] echoes through its halls.
> As the final. notes fade into the earth, there is a long silence. And then, as if to respond in kind, a deep, resounding roar emerges from behind the crimson clouds.*
> MC: (Is that... a dragon?)
> Sacred Judicator: ...It's here. The dragon is here. The true Doomsday Judgement has begun! Get her! Get the bait! 
> *The floor rumbles as the eighteen towering statues surrounding the court pivot, revealing their spearheads. The [[Legion of Justitia]] surge from all directions like a tide, the cold gleam of their blades pointing at the dragon.
> Only upon hearing the [[Sacred Judicator]]'s command do I realize my judgment was actually a trap for the dragon. The flames tremble on the ground.
> Stone feathers launched by the [[Arbiterwings]] pierce through the dragon's wings, while electrified arrows from the Legion lodge themselves in his scales. The wings are nearly shredded, but no amount of damage can stop a dragon in a frenzy.
> It's as if he feels no pain. In the end, I am the only one left standign on this vast platform of the Court of Justitia.
> Through the clouds, the dragon, battered and broken, dives toward me, his eyes filled with nothing but the wild chaos of a beast.
> I know he's just a dragon now. He doesn't recognize me anymore.

> Closing my eyes, I recall that long, drawn-out story about a dragon that I watched in a dim tavern. A man called Sylus was next to me... And in the end, the dragon plunged his bloodied claws into his lover's chest.
* ((The music that plays here is the same as what plays during [[Night of Secrecy]].))

She remembers:
> Sylus: Yet a monster can never truly become a human. He cannot escape his fate as a dragon, nor can he love anyone for long. At the end of the story, he killed his beloved. This is the dragon's curse.

> Yes, it's the end of another story. Facing the wind, I spread my arms. I want to embrace my dragon one last time. But I don't feel an embrace, or the touch of death. Just before the dragon's strike lands, I feel a hand seize my wrist.
> He presses my hand against his chest. I feel the resonance between two souls. 
* ((See also: [[Resonance Evol]]))
> MC: (...Sylus?!)
> *In the split second before the dragon's death blow, under the pull of our resonating souls, the blood-red greatsword reappars in my grasp. My heart lets out a silent scream, yet the sword still pierces the dragon's chest. It looks as if I were the one that plunged it in.*

The ground crackles with fire like lava. Her vision blurs.
> What... have I done...?
> `Kneeling, she looks down at her blood-covered hands.`
> There's... so much blood...

Sylus's voice is heard:
> ...You must press on.

She looks up to see the sword in his chest. His left hand trembles near the pommel, but he doesn't grasp it.
A clock ticks. There's a cut in the cinematic, and her hands are on the sword's grip again.
> Sylus: Because if you don't... There's no going back.

The last image is of her hand gripping the sword.
In a rush of fire, the screen goes black.

> If I fall, fate itself will plunge us into the [[Abyss]] as it was written. I won't be able to go back.
> The dragon grips my hand tightly and uses all his strength to push the sword further into his own chest. It's as if an unyielding life is mocking the curse and making a final stand against fate.
> `A dragon's roar is heard. The background changes to the valley, and golden light flows across it.`
> I hold onto the dragon's neck as we plummet through the clouds together. With the last bit of his strength, the dragon carries me away from the Court of Justitia. We fly over the black obsidian chapel and crash into a valley filled with blooming [[datura]].
> His body lies quietly among the flowers. In his garnet-like eyes is my reflection.
> MC: Look at me... you're not allowed to close your eyes!
> *My tears fall onto him as I lower my head. I allow him to place a kiss on my forehead. The dark-red glow in his eyes dims. Obsidian-like crystals crawl over the dragon's scales, slowly covering his entire body.
> My dragon is gone.
> As his body disintegrates, shards of crystal begin to peel away.
> The wind blows through the valley, lifting those fragments like black petals, wrapping around me--
> At that moment, it feels as if the dragon's soul is passing through my body. His life, everything about him, appears before me.*

> Deep within a cave, the boy who grew up with dragons tightly grips the dagger. He presses the gleaming blade against the base of his tender horn.
> He clenches his teeth. Blood flows down a moment later and passes his right eye that's filled with rage.
> It's not long before they're discovered. All the dragons are killed in the valley except for him. He's taken away as a human.
> But when people saw the horns growing on his head, blades once sheathed were thrust into his chest.
> He rolls into the rubble at the bottom of the valley. His blood boils. He doesn't know how, but he manages to stand. His legs tremble.
> When he comes to his senses, everyone who hurt him is already lying in a pool of blood.
> Black-red mist drifts from their bodies. It travels along the dragon's horns to his tail before entering the wound in the young man's chest.
> His hunched back splits open. From two bloody streaks, two dragon wings struggle to release themselves. They shatter stones as they suddenly unfold.
> The curse he once despised has become his strength.
> He doesn't hesitate this time. He flies into the depths of the valley.

> The dragon bone cradled in my arms dissolves into petals, drifting past me. Everywhere they touch, the bright red [[datura]] flowers turn black.
> I smell a floral fragrance. Is this the scent of his soul that carries a faint, scorching bitterness?
> MC: (Sylus...)
> *My beloved was born into apocalyptic terror. People cursed his existence, fabricated his sins, and celebrated his death.*
> *Only one person ever gazed into his jewel-like eyes, embraced his burning soul, and sang to him in the night wind. He had already etched the traces of his existence deep into my life...*
> *Yet his retaliation against fate pierces my chest like a sword.*
> MC: Sylus... I curse your soul...
> *He says the best way to punish someone is to let them live forever.*
> MC: I curse your soul... to never fade away... You'll always be tied to me. Forever.
> *I pinch the last black petal as if grasping the final piece of his soul--*
> MC: This is my curse... Only I can... Grant you a true death.
> *From the depths of the valley, a faint dragon's roar echoes. The petal flutters, drifting far on the wind, like a dragon returning to the clouds above.
> I feel something sprouting from my head like tender branches. Sharp pain pierces my spine as a dragon's tail replaces my tailbone.
> I walk into the valley that once embraced him.
> It is only after my dragon is gone that I finally become one with him.*
