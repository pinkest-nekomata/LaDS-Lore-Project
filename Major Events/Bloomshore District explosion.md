Occurs on-screen during [[01-04.03 Within Reach]].

Takes place approx 2 weeks after MC becomes a hunter.

[[Grandma]] is killed during the explosion, and [[Caleb]] is presumed dead, though he has actually been recovered by [[Ever]] and becomes victim to their modifications, including [[Caleb's mechanical arm]] and the [[Toring Chip]].

On the day of the explosion, a news report heard in [[01-04.01 Family]] indicates that there have been other explosions attributed to [[Wanderer]] activity. Likewise, in [[01-04.04 A Real Nightmare]], this explosion is classified as an accident due to [[Metaflux]] fluctuations. We later learn that this explosion was the work of [[Ever]], and so it's implied that these other referenced explosions also are.

#todo add a citation for this and confirm: In Long Awaited Revelry, [[Philip]] reports that there were only two explosions on this day/at this time.
