# Summary
After an Apocalypse, [[Philos]] was destroyed. The dead, called [[revenant]]s, dwell in [[Sindersfell]]. Acolytes of the [[Order of Babel]], lead by a [[Bishop]], dwell in a scholarly monastery and pray to return to [[Philos]] before the apocalypse. They blame [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] for Philos's destruction, calling him a sinner, the [[Tyrant]], and the [[Mad King]].

[[Chosen One MC]] washed up on the shore of the [[Sinders]], and the acolytes have been waiting for her to awaken. She has no memories except for an endless darkness, and a single light, which bears an unnamed voice (Xavier's). [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] arrives to cut down the [[revenant]]s, including the [[Bishop]] who reminds Xavier that he can't actually be killed. Thinking she's alone, [[Chosen One MC]] emerges and finds herself at Xavier's swordpoint as he demands to know who she is.

## Commentary

# Details

> It's as if l've been in a long dream.
> My consciousness is an immobilized seed that's buried deep in dark soil.
> The space around me is compressed into an endless void. Without any reference points, it is impossible to sense the passage of time.
> My memories are no different from a thick fog now. Yet occasionally, I hear voices in the distance.
> They fluctuate between being near and far. There are jubilant cheers from the Living and sorrowful sobs from the Dead.
> ??? ((Xavier's voice)): ...I will find you.

This voice causes a light to emerge from the darkness, and eventually a hand grabs her wrist and pulls her out.

> Please pull me out of this endless void.
> Please lead me out of centuries of darkness and solitude

The scene changes to a temple, where [[Chosen One MC]] appears on an altar. The domed roof is crumbling.

A [[Bishop]] says that the [[Chosen One]] has been summoned to deliver [[Philos]]'s survivors from the [[Endless Darkness]]. [[revenant]]s repeat the chat--they have pale faces with empty, intense gazes and are soon revealed to be dead.

The Bishop says they want to return to [[Philos]] prior to the apocalypse, then confirms MC is flesh-and-blood by stabbing her hand with his staff. MC is bewildered.

[[Xavier - King of Darknight]], whose identity is not yet know, gallops in on his dark steed. The gathered acolytes call him the [[Tyrant]] and the [[Mad King]] as he cuts them down.

The [[revenant]]s are revealed to be acolytes of the [[Order of Babel]] residing in a scholarly monastery in [[Sindersfell]]. [[Chosen One MC]] is from [[Philos]] and washed ashore from the [[Sinders]] (a river). They've been waiting for her to awaken. They label [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] as "the sinner who destroyed [[Philos]]."

Instead of fleeing Xavier, the acolytes kneel and sing. MC realizes they're not alive.

The [[Bishop]] entreats Xavier to surrender, offering to absolve him of his sins.
> Bishop: Xavier, relinquish that sword which is bathed in the blood of your brethren. If you do, I shall forgive your slaughter and absolve you of your sins!
> Xavier: ...Sins? What crimes did I commit to become a sinner? Is teaching the Dead to cease their incessant chatter a crime?
> Bishop: You...!

Xavier implies the [[Bishop]] recently sent an assassin to the castle. He indicates that the [[Chosen One]]'s appearance was prophesied.

Before Xavier cuts the [[Bishop]] down, the man says he can't be killed.

Thinking Xavier gone, MC emerges from her hiding place--only for a thrown sword to sink into the stone behind her.

> The night breeze plays with his long hair, but he doesn't move. He stares at me for a long, long time.
> Part of me feels as if we're not meeting for the first time. I could almost believe we're reuniting after being separated for years.

He puts the tip of his sword to her throat and says, "Only the dead dwell in [[Sindersfell]]. So, who exactly are you?"
