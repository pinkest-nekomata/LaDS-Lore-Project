In 2034, a spacetime anomaly appeared above [[Linkon]] City. Bound by a gravitational force and filled with an abundance of barely detectable energy and matter, it raised many questions. From that point on, Earth started to see the emergence of alien creatures known as [[Wanderer]]s. This event sparked curiosity throughout human society. Space exploration truly began in earnest, significantly advancing research in this field.
