# Summary
[[MC]] arrives in the [[N109 Zone]], and though the [[Man in Black]] is trying to take her to [[Sherman]]'s faction of [[Onychinus]], [[Sylus]] intervenes. [[Luke and Kieran]] show themselves first, and [[Sylus]] makes a dramatic entrance, killing the [[Man in Black]]. Sylus comments that she really doesn't remember anything, and then his glowing eye fills her mind with the desire to kill him and take his power. She has a flashback of her sword in his chest from [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]], then passes out. Sylus takes [[MC]] back to [[Sylus's base]].

Once there, he keeps her in a dazed state (similar to the [[Overlord]] in [[Land of Lost]]) for unspecified reasons. Every so often, she 'wakes' and he attempts to resonate with her. Eventually, her power does flow, but then fizzles. They have a confrontation at this point, which excalates in him guiding her gun to his chest and pulling the trigger. (A callback to [[Beyond Cloudfall]].) He doesn't die, and she thinks he's insane.

He relents at this point, letting her recover in bed. She has nightmares of a ravenous void. When she awakes, [[Luke and Kieran]] watch over her. She gets them to show her the "Exit", but they give her instructions to Sylus instead. She overhears a snippet about the [[The Fountain of Atei]], before the man giving the report is devoured by the mist and Sylus beckons her in.

There, she has an insatiable thirst and chugs wine, then is bold enough to try to resonate with Sylus again. He decides she's simply too weak, and gives her ten minutes to eat what she can from the table. Once outside, he takes her via motorcycle to the [[Odd Workshop]], where he tells [[Philip]] he has a new guinea pig.

[[Philip]] reveals his connections to [[Grandma]] and the [[Aether Core]], as well as that [[Sylus]] is not responsible for the [[Bloomshore District explosion]].  [[Sylus]] tries to trigger her power to activate with "stimulation" in the form of a battle with a [[Wanderer]] automaton. These efforts fail, with [[Philip]] warning [[Sylus]] that the resonance rejects him on a subconscious level. Finally, [[Sylus]] relents, leaving [[MC]] with [[Philip]] to ensure her Evol is stable.

It is, and [[Philip]] manages to convince MC to give Sylus a chance--the other predators in the darkness are far worse. 

## Commentary
This arc is full of references to [[Beyond Cloudfall]], establishing for the first time that the Myth content interacts with the main story timeline. Though [[Xavier]] and [[Rafayel]] also have history they remember with MC, [[Sylus]] is the first to be so bold as to reference it to MC. Still, as her inability to resonate forces him to accept that he'll have to be patient, Sylus finds himself not in the mood to "tell stories".

Once consequential translation error is that when Sylus has MC shoot him in the chest, in the EN localization, he says "You wanted my life, and now you've taken it." The meaning of the CN is more like "You wanted my life, but I already gave it to you" as it's meant to be a direct reference to Sylus's pre-existing immortality due to the curse.
