NOTE: In localized EN text, these are called "wavyleaf sea lavenders", see [[#Localization error]] below.

The thematic flower for [[Xavier]] and [[MC]]'s relationship. 

# Localization error
The waveyleaf sea lavender is a real-world flower, ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonium_sinuatum)), but it does not seem to have been localized correctly. Based on the description in [[WU-04 From The Stars#05 Philo]] (quoted above), it should have been localized as forget-me-nots.
* real-world wavyleaf sea lavender has small purple cup-shaped flowers, they aren't bluish as described in-game
* They also do not have five petals or a yellow star in the center--this is characteristic of forget-me-nots

Given that the flowers are visually obviously forget-me-nots, and the EN name powerfully evokes the couple's main theme, this resource consistently refers to them as forget-me-nots.
