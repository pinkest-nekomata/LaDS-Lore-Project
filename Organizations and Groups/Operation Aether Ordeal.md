This operation begins shortly after the end of [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]]. Two months later, the team identifies [[Beta-Protocurve]]s and suspicious [[Wanderer]] activity which is explored in [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]]. It appears that [[Captivating Moment]] also occurs during this time.

The operation is ongoing as of the beginning of [[04 Homecoming Wings]], approx 3-4 months after the end of [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]].
