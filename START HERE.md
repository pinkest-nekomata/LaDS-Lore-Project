Welcome! If you have any general questions about the project, please refer to [[README]].

**It is highly recommended to watch this content in-game first. THERE ARE MANY UNTAGGED SPOILERS HERE, INCLUDING MYTH AND MEMORY SPOILERS.**

I'll keep updating this guide as I add new content, especially overviews and summaries.

For now, the most useful starting place is the [[00 Main Story]] index and the [[Main Story Timeline]], which help put the game's (many) events into perspective.

It will also help for you to familiarize yourself with the shorthand I'm using here, as described below.

# Tips
## Expand/collapse sections
If you're using Obsidian, you an hover over a header to use the little arrow to collapse/expand headers. This is a great way to get an unnecessarily long explanation or aside out of your way!

# Reference

## Abbreviations
* LI = Love Interest
* POV = Point of View
* approx = approximate
* circa = around the time of
* TBA = to be added (usually paired with a #todo tag to remind me to return to it)
* CN = Chinese
* JP = Japanese
* KN = Korean
* EN = English
* i.e. = "that is"
* e.g. = "for example"
* LNY = Lunar New Year

## Citations and notes
* Citations appear in single parentheses and link to the associated page, like this: ([[START HERE]])
* Side-notes and explanations that are clear in canon go in single parenthesees. (These provide additional canon context, and may end with a citation, [[START HERE]])
* Conjecture and inferences go in double parentheses. ((These will usually comment on how likely I think a specific explanation is, and may reference other pages for supporting evidence. Take anything in double parentheses with a grain of salt.))
* Headers labeled "Commentary", "Conjecture", or "Theories" also include inferences/guesses and will usually specifically state how likely I think a theory/connection is, as well as referencing supporting evidence.

## Quotations

Brief quotations of in-game text appear in quotes in the text, "like this".

Longer quotations are set aside in block quotes:
> Like this.
