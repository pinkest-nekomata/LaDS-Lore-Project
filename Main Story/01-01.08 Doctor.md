# Summary

We're introduced to [[Akso Hospital]] and Dr. [[Zayne]]. MC checks in about her heart condition, which is related to the [[Protocore fragments]] in her heart.

# Details

[[MC]] checks in with [[Yvonne]] to confirm that Dr. [[Zayne]] hasn't gone home yet. Yvonne connects MC through to Zayne, who teases her by counting down the seconds remaining until she's considered a no-show.

[[MC]] comments on how [[Yvonne]] told her that Zayne was back to [[Linkon]] at 5am and back to work by 7. Zayne claimed it was a vacation, but MC figures he was actually in the [[Arctic]]. Zayne brushes off the question and asks for her report.

Report text:
* Dynamic Report of Heart Evol Fluctuations
* No 0327685
* Attending Doctor: Zayne
* Re-Examination Needed

Zayne asks about changes, MC says there have been none. She admits to pulling a few all-nighters due to the [[Hunter Exam]]s. As Zayne takes a closer look, she mentions how the [[Protocore fragments]] in her heart and how it's been fourteen years.

Zayne reports that [[MC's heart]] has "Heart arrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions, heart murmurs."
* ((He could be teasing her since the first is just fast heart, rate, the second can be a heart "skipping a beat".))

After briefly discussing how MC became a hunter anyway despite the risks, Zayne gives her a candy.
