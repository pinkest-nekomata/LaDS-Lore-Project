One of [[Professor Lucius]]'s "children". Over 75% of his body is now cybernetic modifications, and higher replacement rates will erode his brain's ability to maintain self-awareness. ([[WU-19 Serpent's Cast#04 Orphan]])

A [[Serpens Class]] [[Evolver]], with DNA homologous to the Viperidae family. He has regenerative abilities and can produce venom.
# Backstory
From [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast#03 Father]]:
Viper was trafficked as a kid, similar to the child he "rescued" in [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast#01 Viper]]. At the [[Evolver Trading Base]], he was referred to by the number 2961, and "customers" could pay to cut him and observe his regeneration. However, the body parts that were severed and grew back were never quite the same as the original. ((Similarly, when [lizards drop their tails](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-environment/2017/05/how-do-lizards-drop-their-tails/), some species grow a tail back but it is usually smaller than the original tail and cannot be dropped.)) His captors cut off his feet and left hand, and the young Viper was terrified of pain.

[[Professor Lucius]] arrived and "rescued" Viper:
> "I want this child. He's perfect. He just needs time to metamorphose. \[...] Come with me. We'll become family, and you'll be reborn. From now on, I'll be your father.  \[...] Family are those who will never betray you."

[[Professor Lucius]] treated Viper's wounds and replaced his mutilated limbs with mechanical parts.
> "You will be my most perfect child. \[...] Viper, you're closer to being the perfect human compared to everyone else."

Unfortunately for [[Viper]], [[Professor Lucius]] ended up discarding him and [[Caleb]] became his favorite instead. This pitted them against each other and made [[Viper]] bitter towards [[Caleb]] from the start.
