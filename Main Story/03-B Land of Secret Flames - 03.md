# Summary
[[Maxwell]] reveals the suspicious piece of jewelry--its blue color evokes the sea. He brushes off rumors that he over-paid for it, saying it's a very special gift for [[Gabriella]] and he'll reveal its true worth soon.

Meanwhile, another altercation with "[[Jester]]" requires [[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] to improvise further. Though Rafayel calls [[Yosef]] his uncle, [[Jester]] decides he's really an illegitimate child instead of a nephew, and that works just as well for their purposes.

# Details
At the banquet, [[Maxwell]] reveals his gift for [[Gabriella]], his wife--an extravagant piece of jewelry that "resembles a solidified, dark blue tranquil ocean." [[Maxwell]] laughs off rumors that his eyes are failing him and he paid way too much for it.

[[Jester]] gives them more trouble, and demands that [[Maxwell]] introduce him to [[Rafayel]]. Rafayel greets [[Maxwell]] "on behalf of my uncle", and [[Maxwell]] seems to recognize him, saying he's [[Yosef]]'s distant nephew--an opera star in the making. [[Jester]] is skeptical, but [[Rafayel]] smugly brushes it off, saying [[Jester]] doesn't now about all the family's legitimate and illegitimate children. [[Jester]] seems satisfied to insult [[Rafayel]] for being an illegitimate child. Rafayel somewhat escalates, stating that MC is his bodyguard and also his manager, and is very protective of him, and [[Maxwell]] diffuses the situation as he takes the intended clue that the two of them are "together".

Once away from the crowd, they chat that the cover story has changed to "illegitimate child" from "nephew" but that still works--[[Yosef]] has too many illegitimate children for it to be a problem.
