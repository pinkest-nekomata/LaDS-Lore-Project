**Description**
> Tagging along Sylus \[sic] means braving hails of bullets and omnipresent dangers, but at this moment, a philanthropist gives us another choice.

# Summary
At a safehouse, Sylus is injured and bleeding heavily from his arm. MC is helping him. This turns out to be a dream, which she realizes as she wakes up in her living room. (See also [[Sylus and MC's dreamscape]].) Concerned, she gives him a call. Finding him nonchalant as usual, she banters with him a bit. In hiding her real reason for calling, she leads him to deduce that she's inviting him to the birthday banquet she's attending for a philanthropist she helped.

MC goes dress shopping, but gets overwhelmed. Sylus calls, saying he's on [[Grand Center]]'s top floor--the same place she is. He tells her to come join him, and she arrives at a high-end boutique to find [[Luke and Kieran]] there. Sylus is trying on a suit and asks for help picking a tie. It's revealed he's also picking out an outfit for the birthday banquet and he wants her input. Since the staff are nowhere to be seen, MC helps take his measurements for a custom suit.

Sylus ends up noticing that she's checking for injuries, and she admits to it in a roundabout way. He suggests that if they have more happy experiences, maybe she'll have better dreams.

# Key Info
* Based on their banter early in the memoria ("I'll have to trouble you again, kitten." / "It's nice to see you remembered etiquette when asking for help this time.") this occurs after [[No Way Out]], in which Sylus calls for MC's help with an injury for the first time.
	* This turns out to be a dream
* MC's starting to feel nervous when she runs into him, which is a key turning point. Given that she's reaching out to him, this most likely takes place after [[Razor's Dance]].
* After taking Sylus's measurements, MC checks his arm for wounds like she noticed in her dream, and Sylus picks up on this, asking about it with a more tentative/serious tone.
	* He correctly guesses she was looking for injuries, saying, "It wasn't the gaze for finding tattoos"
	* It's possible he also experienced and remembered the dream.
	* She ends up finding a nonchalant way to say he always gets her into trouble, so now she's tending to his wounds in her dreams.

# Trivia
* MC once saved a [[Mr. Romero]], a philanthropist who often appears in the news.
	* to express his gratitude, he invited her to his birthday banquet.
* Sylus changed MC's ringtone to Mephisto squawking.
* [[Grand Center]] is a high-end mall in [[Linkon]].
* When Sylus shops, he clears out the boutique so he won't be interrupted.
