"I still remember that from fourteen years ago. It was also a lively evening. The roars of Wanderers, like a flood, drowned out the screams and cries for help. I sprint through the street covered in rubble, not even knowing what monster is chasing me. Until a sharp pain pierces me and burrows itself into my heart.

A makeshift shelter made of the remains of collapsed buildings is within sight. Trembling, I muster all the strength I have and crawl toward it. Amidst the dirt and gloom, a small seedling breaks through the soil. If I survive this, I don't want to be anyone's prey. I don't want to only run when there's danger..." -- [[MC]] internal monologue, [[01-01.06 UNICORNS]]

"During the Chronorift Catastrophe, the first [[Wanderer]] to be killed was [[Tezcatlipoca]]." -- [[Xavier]], [[01-03.04 Maze]]

# Spacepedia
Fourteen years ago, with the opening of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], countless [[Wanderer]]s invaded Earth and began attacking humans. Many lives were lost. Among the affected areas, [[Linkon]] City suffered the highest number of casualties.
