# Details
[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] remain somewhat trapped by the energy fluctuations. Xavier comments, "Why do you always happen to be around when I'm in trouble?"

They spot some [[Wanderer]]s that can distort space and exhaust their prey before trapping it--they seem to be the culprits. MC tries to come up with a plan, but Xavier has already teleported down and killed them.

With the Wanderers taken care of, a new path becomes clear.
