Title: Love and Deepspace | Rafayel: Fish ([YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km-A0712YW0))

The launch trailers contain some specific information not otherwise in the game. This was posted Nov 4, 2023.

Voiceover:
> Rafayel: It was before you met me.

The video shifts from an underwater background to Rafayel's art studio. The song called "Song of Lost" in the OST plays. ((This is the same one linked to [[Raymond's painting]], and connected to the Siren's Balled/Siren's Lament in [[Siren's Song]].))

Subtitles are provided for the song ((which is presumably in [[Lemurian]])):
> A fish in your hand
> Please burn with passion
> Nets of moonlight
> With coral, a prison
> When waves kiss the morning sun
> The scent of roses pierce
> With a fish in your hand
> Blood
> Blood
> Blood covers the sea

Meanwhile, [[Rafayel]] paints. Then he caresses a statue with flowers around it, and his flames burn the petals. He catches a petal in his hand, burning it as well.

When the song ends, the scene changes.

Voiceover:
> Rafayel: This is a story you've forgotten.

On-screen text:
> On December 31st, 2034, there was a tsunami to the southeast of [[Linkon]].
> In the depths of the rift left behind by the earthquake lay an ancient city.
> [[Lemuria]], the marine civilization though tot be lost to the sands of time, has reappeared.

# Commentary
Getting a translation for the Siren's Ballad, which is an elegy for [[Lemuria]] ([[Siren's Song]]), is very significant.
* "A fish in your hand" evokes a sense of vulnerability. Especially since the title of the trailer is "Rafayel: Fish", he's "in your hand". We later learn that [[the pact]] and [[The Day of Ebbing]] make [[Lemurian]]s extremely vulnerable to humans under certain conditions. Likewise, references to nets and prison evoke capture.
* "With coral, a prison" could be a reference to how the [[coral stone]] allows [[Rafayel]] to weave an illusion into [[Raymond's painting]], ultimately killing him.
* Blood on the water is a recurring theme too. When Rafayel describes the "dream" that inspired [[Raymond's painting]], he mentions dreaming of being a fish swimming and swimming from the depths, only to end up in blood-red water. This striking blood-red is in the painting, and the idea of blood covering the sea evokes the [[Lemurian disaster]].
