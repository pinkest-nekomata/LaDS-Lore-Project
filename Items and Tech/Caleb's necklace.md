[[MC]] originally gave it to [[Caleb]]. It has a silver apple-shaped charm with a red gem in it, and a rounded rectangular tag with the text, "When U Come Home".

MC ends up giving it to Caleb twice. Whenever it's in his possession, he's always wearing it.

MC first gave it to [[Caleb]] when he's departing for the [[Skyhaven Aerospace Academy]] for the first time. (Flashback in [[01-04.06 Saying Goodbye]])

Caleb loses it during [[01-04.03 Within Reach]] during the [[Bloomshore District explosion]], and then MC gives it back to him during [[Homecoming Wings]].
