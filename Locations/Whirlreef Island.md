Once a natural island in a lake, during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] gravity and magnetic field anomalies caused it to rise into the sky. Once it was stabilized, it became part of [[Skyhaven]].

(( #todo the shape implies that this becomes Skyhaven's main island--double check this against in-game art))

All residents of the island were given residential rights in [[Skyhaven]] and its Guard Stations after the project was completed.

As described in [[WU-15 Sketches Vol 13]], originally, it was a coral island. Coral-consuming microorganisms slowly consumed the island's base beneath the lake. This ended up causing the underside of the island to become a downward-facing point. The island's core was highly magnetic, so it began to spin under the influence of the planet's [[Protofield]] (ie magnetic field), eroding both itself and the lake it was within into circles.

Due to these effects, most residents were school faculty and researchers in geology and physics. Was home to the [[Whirlreef Institute of Technology]] which later merged with [[Skyhaven University]].

Then, when the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] occurred and the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] appeared, the altered magnetic field and "[[gravity vortex]]" caused the island to rise into the sky. This inspired the "Skyhaven Project".
