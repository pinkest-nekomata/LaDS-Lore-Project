# Chapter 1
As Caleb's birthday approaches, he invites MC to a photo studio to take annual birthday photos. But many were lost in the [[Bloomshore District explosion]]. MC tries and fails to sneak up on Caleb. He's printing the old photos saved to the cloud, and MC interprets this as him nudging her to plan his party. They look at the photos together, reminiscing. There's a theme of them trying to spend time together alone, even as Caleb's friends were trying to hang out with him. MC made his cake every year, but barely got to eat any because of his friends. They'd sneak out together after the parties.

> Caleb: This year will be different. Whether it's the cake or that other thing on your mind—It's all yours.
> MC:  ...How do you know what I'm thinking about?
> Caleb: We've spent sooo many years together. Do you really need to ask at this point?
> *Caleb lifts the photo album in his hand as if to jog my memory.*
> Caleb: You're the only one celebratin' my birthday with me this year.

MC wonders if perhaps this year will be different after all, and maybe Caleb feels the same way.
# Chapter 2
MC works on planning Caleb's birthday:
> Various ideas come to mind for Caleb's birthday.
> Our pasts are so deeply intertwined that if either of us were removed, the memories wouldn't be complete.
> And here in the present, I secretly want our lives to remain like that.
> But after all that we've been through, what can I give to Caleb?
> And what does Caleb want from me?

MC pays him a surprise visit. She catches him right after a workout. They banter about birthday planning. After showering, Caleb invites MC to help him with a model plane kit. MC notes that it looks familiar, and Caleb reveals that they used to have one at their house. He's been collecting all the old kits they used to have before the explosion and rebuilding them, but some have been discontinued.

> MC: I've been thinking about what I could do for you. Like what I can give you and what you want from me.
> Caleb: In other words, you want a direct answer from me?
> MC: Is that a bad thing?
> Caleb: Hmm... I'll be honest since you're curious. A few years ago, I got called away for a mission. That was the one time I couldn't spend my birthday with you.
* ((Strictly speaking, he also missed the birthday where he was, y'know, PRESUMED DEAD FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. (Sorry for the feelings lol.)))

> Caleb: You booked a table at my favorite restaurant back then, right? Let's go there this year. It can't make up for what we missed, but we'll be able to overwrite those old memories with better ones at least.

MC presses for more. He teases her a bit, then says he wants more of her in his everyday life. She teases him back, then he offers one more hint--he books a [[Cloudpiercer]] outing with her.

> Caleb: Let's fly. Once we're in the sky, you'll understand.

# Chapter 3
[[Caleb]] and [[MC]] head out on their [[Cloudpiercer]] ride on vintage aircraft.

When MC says she's nervous:
> Caleb: I was nervous when I first flew one of these years ago. I tried all sorts of tricks to calm down. Eventually, I found two things that work best.
> MC: What are they?
> *He deftly adjusts the knobs, and I can imagine the person he used to be—that Aerospace Academy student who ranked first.*
> Caleb: First, treat the aircraft like it's part of you. Trust it and trust yourself.
> *Caleb turns to me. The necklace I gave him sways gently and glimmers under the cockpit's lights.*
> Caleb: As for the second, give yourself a reason for why you have to land safely. Like... Someone's waiting for me

Caleb guides MC through takeoff, then tells her he'll handle things once they're in the air. He's gentle and supportive as he guides her through flying for the first time.

> Caleb: Once you're up here, you feel like nothing can stop you. It's like you can do *anything*.
> *Back then, he was bold and sure of himself. Like my shield who protected me from the world, he could deal with anything.*

MC asks if he still feels that way, and he avoids the question, pointing out landmarks from their childhood and life together.

> Caleb: l've... realized I *can't* do everything. Sometimes, I get outmaneuvered.
> *He speaks nonchalantly, but his words sting. Even Caleb, who I thought was invincible, had moments where he doubted himself?*
> Caleb: But I also know that l'm not alone. Someone is always there, looking up at the same sky with me. So for her sake, I won't let those negative thoughts get to me. For now, at least.
> *Watching the lights that are reflected in his eyes, I realize it might be my turn to shield him from the world for a change.*
> MC: I hope those kinds of thoughts never trouble you.
> *We keep flying, and clouds roll in overhead. For a moment, darkness and uncertainty cloud our view.*
> MC: We'll break through the clouds together.
> Caleb: Let's do it.
> *Outside the cockpit, the night sky above Linkon and Skyhaven is alive with sparkling lights and constant traffic.*
> *Yet here we are, above it all. It's like this place is our secret base. Our little world.*
> Caleb: Isn't it beautiful?
> MC: Yeah... So this is the sky you usually see.
> Caleb: It always feels brighter after you pass through the darkness.

Caleb asks if she understand what she can do for him, and she replies that she can, then rests her head on his shoulder and enjoys the peaceful moment together.
