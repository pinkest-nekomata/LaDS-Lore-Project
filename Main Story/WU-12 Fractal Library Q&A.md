The [[Administrator]] of the [[Fractal Library]] answers questions in the guest book, hinting at its true owner ([[Zayne - Foreseer]]).
# Summary
The [[Administrator]] of the mystical [[Fractal Library]] answers questions in the guest book, creating a meta-commentary on narrative itself and a bit of a love letter to stories and storytellers. 

Despite being imagined as a "library", a conversation at the end reveals that "books" are used symbolically to represent stories, and those in a comic book (or, say, video game) are considered just as valid.

Since this story is short, only the key details relevant to the lore are pulled out below.

## Commentary

### Owner
> I'm waiting for someone. I know an atheist will step through these doors one day. That person is the library's true owner.
> [[#02 Question 2]]

We know [[Zayne - Foreseer]] to be the library's true owner. "Atheist" should not be understood through an overly Christian/Western lens. Rather, note how [[Zayne - Foreseer]] specifically interacts with [[Astra]], who is described in [[Tower of Secrets]] as the god of fate. Furthermore, [[Zayne - Master of Fate]] is himself a fate diety.

In essence, to not "believe in" [[Astra]], a character we know to exist in the story, can be understood as:
* Not recognizing the authority of the god of fate, or fate itself
* Actively rejecting the sacred, holy status of fate
* Generally being willing to take control of one's own fate, not leaving it up to the gods

### Zayne's Story
[[#03 Question 3]] seems to provide a symbolic narrative tying to [[Zayne]]'s story overall. 

There is a "light" world where everything is perfectly efficient, but a "flawless" person causes cracks that then result in a "dark" world where that "flawless" person is responsible for gradually killing the humans that have been infected with a virus that cause them to lose their humanity and become a type of energy that "will perish with the planet".

This has conspicuous similarities to the contrast between [[Zayne - Linkon Doctor]] and [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]], also hinting at [[human to Wanderer transformation]] and the way that [[Philos]]'s planetary energy is tied to energy deriving from humans. The lonely moment as the "last person" hints at [[Zayne - Foreseer]]'s solitude in [[Tower of Secrets]].

As for what it means, there are some potential interpretations:
* When "light" and "dark" are too separated, the result is two worlds that would be terrible to live in
* Adaptability is a threat to a world overly obsessed with efficiency
* An immortal and "flawless" existence is ultimately a lonely one
* Cancer cells are harmless until their "immortality" causes them to take over the whole system, consuming it until everything dies (a striking allegory to [[Ever]])
### Fractals
The story is fairly self-explanatory about the meaning of the "fractal" part, but for those not familiar, a "fractal" is a type of shape with a pattern that repeats infinitely and gets tinier and tinier. Because the shape repeats, you can "zoom in" on a fractal and it might look exactly the same as the part of it you just "zoomed in" from!

They are "[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)" shapes, meaning the same process repeats back on itself over and over.

Fractals have some really interesting mathematical properties, and are also quite beautiful. The symbolic use here mostly focuses on the ideas of patterns repeating at tinier and tinier scales (or at larger and larger scales).

# 01 Question 1
The [[Administrator]] explains that they fell in love with the place because of its unusual name and the way that it contains infinite stories. The Administrator comments on the recursive nature of storytelling (such as how sentences, paragraphs, scenes, chapters, books, and series all have their own arcs), and how even very different stories have striking similarities.

While they're reading, a mysterious ten minute phone call invites them to become the [[Administrator]] and they agree.

They consider renaming it to the 10^-33 Library because:
> every time I open a new one, it feels like I'm witnessing the birth of a universe, that instant of 10^-33 seconds when the cosmos explores from a tiny singularity

But whenever they consider it, the phone rings and reminds them that it belongs to someone else. ((This underscores the mystical nature of the library.))

# 02 Question 2
The [[Administrator]] hints that the library has an eternal existence: "It's always been here."

> Perhaps all the things we consider impossible now and the mysteries we haven't observed really exist somewhere... Maybe in the future, or maybe in another universe. I choose to believe in the worlds that you can find in those stories.
* See also: [[past, present, and future coexist]]

> I'm waiting for someone. I know an atheist will step through these doors one day. That person is the library's true owner.
* ((From [[Tower of Secrets]], we know [[Zayne - Foreseer]] to be the library's true owner. See above for more commentary.))

# 03 Question 3

The [[Administrator]] describes their favorite story, which is meant to be understood in the context of [[Zayne]]'s character:

In a world obsessed with efficiency, people had only numbers, and embryo testing made sure every person had the most "efficient" life. Everything was decided ahead of time; education, work, love, marriage, even the traits of their children. The talents "bestowed by the gods" via genetics were fully realized.

Then a wealthy person engineered a child without flaws.
> This child could adapt to anything, yet he revered nothing. He soared above every rule and sneered at order itself. Cracks in the system appeared, and where there are cracks, rebellion follows.
* Note that rebellion itself, having nothing to revere, etc, are not considered "flaws" in this narrative.
* Adaptability and flexibility ultimately "undo" this "harmonious" world

The administrator comments that rebels are branded as traitors and condemned in history.
* Note also how these talents were "bestowed by the gods" and the library's owner, [[Zayne]], is an "athiest". In this context, to be an "atheist" means that these pre-determined "talents" shouldn't be what defines a person's life.

> I encountered another world. It was nothing like that harmonious place I described before. By the time I looked at it, it was already on the brink of death. Everyone but "him" had fallen victim to a virus that stripped away the human form and humanity. It turned people into an energy that would perish along with the planet.
* Compare to [[human to Wanderer transformation]], and how [[Philos]]'s core is fueled by energy that was once human and results in the creation of [[Wanderer]]s.

> It reminded me of cancer cells--once harmless symbionts that entered a frenzy of endless replication until they destroyed their host and died with it. Al of it done for the sake of immortality.
* Compare to [[Ever]]'s goal of immortality, which results in [[human to Wanderer transformation]] starting to happen in the main story (see also [[X-Heart]]).

> To prevent this calamity from spreading elsewhere, "he" became that world's lone survivor. He had a single mission: Eliminate every infected individual, root out every trace of this disease, and then guard those warm "remains" until they had fully crumbled away.
* Compare to [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]], whose mission is to destroy the [[Abomination]]s as they arise

> He waited for what felt like an eternity until all drifted into emptiness. He became a prisoner of time, the embondiment of loneliness, forever the last person.
* Compare to the solitary stasis of [[Zayne - Foreseer]] in [[Tower of Secrets]]

The administrator also notes that "Happy stories are the same, but unhappy stories each have their own kind of unhappiness" which is actually a reference to this quote:
> “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." 
> --Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7142-all-happy-families-are-alike-each-unhappy-family-is-unhappy))

They go on to say:
> Once a story finds its perfect ending, it stops, and no one looks back. Imperfections, however, remain unforgettable. They echo without a response until the end of time.
* ((This is a meta comment on a reason that the LaDS writers often write tragedy and struggle in the LI's Myths, memories, etc. They know it will be more memorable. They're hinting that we'll never get any "perfect ending" for the characters in the game, but ultimately, that's what allows the story to go on.))

The administrator muses that if the stories in the library are truly peoples' lives, then they must be "playgrounds for some god's whim". This ties back to the "atheist" theme, and also hints at writers playing god when creating stories.
> Bits and pieces thrown together without a second thought, proportions guided by mood, one failure after another. Each would be more fleeting than a grain of sand and a flicker of light.

# 04 Question 4
The [[Administrator]] reflects on how we each create the universe of our life, and though we may be small in the cosmic scale, within our own universe we are everything.

> The universe isn't good or bad. It's simply a collection of stories following their own laws.
* Compare to the Yin and Yang theme of [[Zayne]]'s character overall, and how [[Zayne - Master of Fate]]'s job is to balance those forces, etc.

# 05 To Be Continued
There's what appears to be a one-sided phone call where the [[Administrator]] is talking to someone who's working on a book, and they're discussing finding/waiting for the library's true owner.

They say "I'm in [[Linkon]] City now, so I have to stick to the schedule here", and since they're always in the library, this hints that the mystical library can materialize in different places.

They notice it's 10am exactly, saying "nobody manages time as precisely as that caller".

They also get a "100% sugar sea salt cheese latte with double whipped cream and chocolate drizzle" which is a nod at [[Zayne]]'s sweet tooth.

A child stops by, and when invited in, he also hints at the library's strange nature:
> "A library? But most of these things don't look like books..."

The administrator replies:
> "When you want to read them, they'll take on a form that's easy for you to understand. Books are the ideal medium. But if you prefer cartoons, that works too."
* Or if you prefer, say, otome video games ;)

> If each "book" holds a tiny world, and everyone who enters a library seeks some kind of answer... Then I hope you find your own "singularity" in this little library--your personal starting point, your own universe. I might not meet all your expectations, but I'll still say the following with sincerity: "Hello! Welcome to the Fractal Library!"
* A sweet meta-comment and well-wish from the writers of the game :)
