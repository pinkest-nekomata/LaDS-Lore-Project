# Summary
[[Sorceress MC]] and [[Sylus]] refuse to talk about the words they exchanged that day, and continue their path of plunder. But the curse rears its head all too soon.

After a successful plunder of a Sanctuary, MC finds a pipe organ and plays the beginning of the [[requiem]], but stops when she decides that the dead her don't deserve it. She's also teasing Sylus a bit.

The duo enjoys the throne room, and a moment of closeness. But MC feels the mark on her neck burning with desire. (Mistakenly, she assumes his desire is for blood. But it's implied that it's really his desire for her that drives the hunger--and causes the madness.) 

Sylus begins to speak with his draconic voice, reminding her she's nothing more than a piece of food to him. He loses control, attacking her and trying to drain her soul again. On the brink of death, she instinctively draws the sword and plunges it through his chest.

Horrified, she tries to defend the grievously wounded dragon from the incoming soldiers. But the madness overtakes him, and he transforms into his full draconic form, stumbling through the city and causing destruction before flying to Tarus City, trailing blood.

# Details
> What happened that night at the tavern, along with the words we exchanged, is never brought up by us ever again.
> By the light of day, it became a dark, absurd secret hanging between us.
> [[Tarus]] City revels every night, where shallow desires are easier to face than genuine feelings.
> With the return of the Fiend, Doomsday's ominous shadow once again haunts the war-torn land of [[Philos]].
> Under the guise of exterminating the Fiend, the [[Legion of Justitia]] sparks wars across the planet. Those who dare to oppose them are branded as "Sinners" and put on trial in the Court of Justitia.
> The [[Sacred Judicator]]'s authority hangs by a thread. The long-standing resentment among the people reaches its boiling point, and it's fueled by the Fiend's resurgence.
> Meanwhile, Sylus and I pay no mind to it all. Our path of plunder stretches across nearly every corner of the world.
> But... amid this feast of desires, as my thirst for revenge deepens, the cursed dark clouds gather thicker around me and the dragon, casting ever darker shadows over our fates.

[[Sorceress MC]] and [[Sylus]] are pillaging another Sanctuary. Its oracle begs to live, but he's swiftly cut down by mist. They take the key to the luxurious inner sanctum. This place is particularly sophisticated, and the traps even managed to injure Sylus, but that hardly slowed them down.

Behind a curtain, Sylus notices a pipe organ. They pause their pillaging and MC sits at the keys.
> *Melodious music resounds while the wind sweeps through the building. Sunlight casts a radiant glow and harmoniously blends with the enchanting melody. My performance ends, and the Sanctuary falls silent.*
> Sylus: Why did you stop?
> *I get up and retrieve the sword resting near the organ.*
> MC: A [[requiem]] is meant to soothe the dead, but the souls in this place don't deserve it.
> *Standing on my tiptoes, I move closer to Sylus. As soon as he narrows his eyes, I quickly step to the side and gracefully ascend the stairs.*
> MC: They were sanctimonious enough when they were alive--I have no intention of praising their ugly souls. What I desire is...
> *My fingers brush over the renowned painting adorning the wall. I turn, lift the hem of my dress, and sit on the sacred throne positioned at the top of the stairs. I point my toes, and in silence, I hook my leg around the dragon's as he reaches the last step. Just as he leans forward, I tug him closer.*
> MC: To live freely and die without regrets.
> *Our breaths mingle, and our heartbeats sync. Light ripples in his eyes, and his lips slowly curl into a smile. With a flick of his tail, he catches me off guard, wrapping it around my waist and pulling me in.*
> Sylus: Are you aware of your soul's scent?
> *He meets my gaze, leaning in provacatively. His breath teasingly caresses the pulse in my neck.*
> Sylus: It's akin to a strong liquor topped off with salt... Forever boiling and never satisfied.
> *A shiver ripples through me, deep in my body. The mark on my shoulder burns with a heat like never before. I wonder what's boiling inside the dragon... at this very moment. I don't retreat. In this intimate proximity, I reach out to brush my fingers against his lashes.*
> MC: And you? What is it... that you desire?
> *The fading sunset casts a hazy glow over everything, spilling over his brow and rolling down his throat. He says nothing. I take his silence as consent, but just as I reach for his right eye, my wrist is suddenly gripped tight.*
> MC: !
> *The moment his skin touches mine, memories tainted by a bloody hue flash before my eyes. A bloodstained young man turns his head in unfathomable darkness. He seems to be...*
> Sylus: `(Pulling away)` You ask too many questions.
> *His voice shatters the illusion. I return to reality, and Sylus has already released my hand. A sinister, blood-red gleam flashes in his eye.*
> MC: ...Where are you going?
> Sylus: I've never asked *you* that.
> MC: It's a shame I won't ever learn how to be tactful.
> *The mark on my shoulder throbs and burns. I move ahead of him and block his path.*
> MC: Were those guards not enough for you? 
> Sylus: `(Tersly)`...What?
> MC: You still want to hide it from me?
> *I sweep the strands of hair away from my neck, revealing the mark he left behind.*
> MC: Whenever your hunger for souls flares up, this mark you gave me stirs too. Lately, it's been acting up more frequently. 
> Sylus: `(Scoffs)`
> *I take a step toward him. Without hesitating, I caress the area around his eye.*
> MC: ?! `(Heartbeats are heard)`
> *When our skin touches again the mark on my shoulder flares with heat, and a familiar, searing pain floods through me.*
> Sylus: ... `(Labored breath)`
> *I stagger back. Yet an inexplicable bond persists and connects me to him.*
> Sylus: `(draconic voice)` Crossing the line again and again and again... Other than your desire, your audacity is boundless.
> *Suddenly, a force erupts, flinging me several steps away. I brace myself against the edge of a table, steadying my stance. As I lift my head, I notice thin wisps of dark mist slipping from beneath Sylus's hand, which covers his right eye.*
> MC: Sylus, you...?!
> *Thick clouds silently shroud the Sanctuary's ceiling. Half of his body sinks into the shadows, and he lowers his arm with a ragged breath. Black-red energy particles drift from the corners of his eyes, and his gaze is now completely drenched in blood-red.*
> Sylus: `(draconic voice)` Did you forget what I truly am?
> *The oncoming black mist binds my limbs. Sylus's face is lost in the shadows, hidden from view.*
> MC: (...Something's wrong with him right now!)
> *The shackle around my neck suddenly tightens, and the pain from the depths of my soul strikes again.*
> MC: Are you going to devour me? No you wont--Ugh!
> Sylus: `(draconic voice)` I won't? Have you spun so many lies that you've begun to believe them yourself? `(growls)` Shall I remind you? You are nothing. You are but a soul that was fed by a fiend.
> MC: (No... this isn't who he really is...!)
> *The mark on my shoulder grows like thorns. It tightens its grip around my body. My strength drains away, my vision blurs. With my senses slipping, all that remains is an empty husk.*
> Sylus: `(draconic voice)` So long as I desire it, I can feast at any time...
> *My body thrashes. In the vast void of near-death, the chaotic screams in my mind slowly crystallize...*
> MC: (Eat... Eat. him. Devour him...! Eat... Eat him...)
> *A thin streak of [[golden light]] bursts from the mark and surges down my arm to my palm, shattering the bind that holds me. The terrifying suffocation devours my consciousness. Yet something appears in my hand and guides me to strike at Sylus.*
> `The sword slashes. Sylus grunts in pain.`
> Sylus: ...!
> *Warm liquid splashes onto my cheek. The blood-red greatsword solidifies from a phantom into reality, and I thrust it into his chest.*
> MC: ?!
> *His scarlet eyes widen in disbelief as we lock gazes, the air heavy with silence between us.*
> [[Judicator's Oracle]]: The dragon... the Fiend has been slain!
> *The [[Judicator's Oracle ]]bursts into the Sanctuary with the [[Legion of Justitia]], their voice frantic and uneven as they shout out.*
> [[Judicator's Oracle]]: Capture it! Capture it now!
> *My hand trembles. The sword dissolves, turning into light and returning to my body. The force restraining me loses its grip. I fall onto the pristine floor of the Sanctuary.*
> MC: No... That sword... I didn't mean to...!
> *Blood bursts from Sylus's chest, and the soldiers' blades are poised right at his head. In his current condition, facing off against the Legion is a grave risk. I grit my teeth, get up, and shove past the white stone doors behind us. The doors slam shut. I turn and snatch up a weapon, pointing it at the soldiers crowding in.*
> MC: You saw it yourselves--The Fiend couldn't best me. Anyone who steps closer will meet their end by this sword!


> Behind the white stone doors, blood continues to fall onto the floor. It seeps out from the cracks. The whispers of desire grow louder. The blood-red hue in Sylus's vision surges and boils. His gaze is nearly drowned in crimson. 
> Ignoring the grievous injury from the greatsword, he only knows that the curse almost came true. He almost lost his mind and killed her.
> The boiling, nearly irrational urge to kill rages on, refusing to calm. The wounds on his body remain open, unhealed. He gets down on one knee, and sharp claws begin to sprout from the hand covering his right eye.
> An irresistible force pierces through his flesh and bones. It transforms into massive wings that spread wide from his back.
> The sanctuary's pristine bell tower trembles as a savage force destroys it from within. A roar resounds from the collapsing rubble.
> The mad dragon spreads his wings and surges forth before crashing to the ground amidst the humans' screams.
> Wings struggle to flap. He stumbles. A vortex stirs, nearly leveling all the buildings in its path. And then, he finally flies toward the distant Tarus City.
