This is a key concept in [[Xianxia]] fiction, which refers to gathering internal energy (chi) over time to become stronger--and eventually achieve immortality.

It's closely tied to the [[Xianxia]] theme of "cores" as well--i.e. "cultivator cores." In this game, which blends [[Xianxia]] themes with Western fantasy and Sci-Fi elements, [[Protocore]]s take on this role. (See also ["Cores" in Chinese Cultivation Novels](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/page/cores-in-chinese-cultivation-novels))

Note that in [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]], [[Raincoat 2]] specifically refers to MC undergoing the process of cultivation to gain power in her [[Aether Core]].

This is accomplished by [cultivating](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cultivate) [Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi) and training in martial & mystical arts. In many of these novels, the ultimate goal of cultivation is to become an [Immortal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)) or attain godhood.
