# Overview
Relevant LI: [[Caleb]]
Main POV Character: [[Viper]]
Cover image: [[Viper]] and [[Professor Lucius]]

[[Viper]] reflects on his relationship with [[Professor Lucius]] as [[Caleb]]'s body is recovered from the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] and repaired.

# Summary
[[Viper]] recovers a young [[Evolver]] from the trafficking organization [[Viridilus]]. Against [[Professor Lucius]]'s wishes, he kills the group's leader, taking revenge for his own childhood experience of being trafficked.

Viper returns with the girl to the [[Toring Cyberkinetics Institute]], where [[Caleb]] has just been recovered from the [[Bloomshore District explosion]]. Caleb is near death due to having used his [[Evol]] to contain the blast, thus sparing [[MC]] from injury ((but not being able to save [[Grandma]])). [[Professor Lucius]] takes a break form working on Caleb's "repairs", which are facing issues due to him rejecting the [[Toring chip]] technology, to greet the young girl. 

He welcomes her to the "family", but as soon as she's gone the shallow nature of his affection is revealed, especially in how he's discarded [[Viper]], who he used to call his "perfect" child.

[[Viper]] reflects on when he first went to investigate [[Caleb]] four years ago (2044) and he's always had an antagonistic relationship with [[Caleb]] due to [[Professor Lucius]] deprioritizing him in favor of Caleb.

## Commentary
This story confirms some key facts that have been implied in other places, and provides some helpful concrete timeline information for Caleb's age and years at the [[Aerospace Academy]].

### Timing
Based on the [[Main Story Timeline]], the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] most likely happened in summer 2048. There aren't specific season details in [[01-04.01 Family]], though it doesn't appear to be winter. However, this story mentions snow on the ground at the [[abandoned circus]].

### Caleb's "communication device"
[[Professor Lucius]] reflects: "Fragments of a broken communication device were still lodged in his collar, which had been stained in blood. Perhaps this was the last piece of evidence that proves his attempt to contact someone before the explosion."

Since he was speaking with MC literally seconds before the explosion, it's not immediately clear who this contact would be. If the "collar" here is his jacket/shirt collar, then this is perhaps a hidden communication device.

# 01 Viper
> 2048, Nighttime

At the [[abandoned circus]] in the suburbs, with snow on the ground, [[Viper]] disrupts one of [[Viridilus]]'s human trafficking bases. He kills all the VIP "guests" (ie buyers) then toys with the auction manager and their "true boss", before killing both of them. 
* ((See above for discussion on the season/timing))

[[Viper]] then retrieves a specific young girl from the cages.

((It's later revealed that Viper was only supposed to extract the girl without causing a commotion. His bloody and dramatic revenge is due to his having been trafficked himself as a child.))

# 02 Toring Cyberkinetics Institute
[[Viper]] drives the car he stole from [[Viridilus]]'s boss into another vehicle to "park" in front of the [[Toring Cyberkinetics Institute]]. He heads inside with a leather suitcase.

Within the institute, researchers gather around a cryogenic experiment chamber. In a white room, six mechanical arms operate on [[Caleb]]:
> "Right arm bionic nerve interface complete... Compatibility readings are good."
> "I can't believe he actually survived this," a researcher remarks, their gaze fixed on the digital display.

[[Professor Lucius]] observes the operation:
> Nano-threads from the mechanical arm cover Caleb's right arm like a silver spider web. As dead nerves reconnect and the newly formed mechanical fingers flex unconsciously, his eyelashes suddenly flutter. His muscles tense involuntarily, and a suppressed groan escapes his throat...
> The warning light on the digital display flashes once again.
> "... System error. Chip reading failed... Unable to access primary consciousness... Chip.. Reinitializing Chip processes... Memory input..."
> "Another failure. It's been three days, and the [[Toring chip]] has yet to analyze the entirety of his consciousness..." The researcher's fingertip glides across the digital screen. The synapses representing pain perception are oscillating at a high frequency. Even in a comatose state, the body continues to actively resist the chip's influence.
> This should be impossible for someone in a coma.
> "I've never seen anyone with mental defenses of this caliber... You could even say that the fighter pilots at the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] might not have this level of psychological resilience. Just who is he?"

[[Professor Lucius]] reflects on how he recovered [[Caleb]] from the rubble of the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] three days ago. He knows that Caleb is Test Subject 002, that MC was called Unicorn, and that [[Grandma]] (Josephine) hid both children away. 

Based on his analysis, the reason for Caleb's near-death is that he used his [[Evol]] to contain the blast, taking on the brunt of the explosion. ((This was not enough to save [[Grandma]], whose health was poor to begin with, but likely spared [[MC]].))

Lucius notes that when Caleb was recovered:
> Fragments of a broken communication device were still lodged in his collar, which had been stained in blood. Perhaps this was the last piece of evidence that proves his attempt to contact someone before the explosion.
* (In [[01-04.03 Within Reach]], mere seconds before detonation, there's no visual sign of a comms device on Caleb's ear or neck. There's also no indication he'd have anyone to be communicating with. So, this may be a hidden device related to his work with the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]].))

[[Professor Lucius]] instructs the researchers to try again, for the 429th time.
* (( #todo any significance to this number?))

[[Viper]] abruptly interrupts, addressing [[Professor Lucius]] as "father" and saying he brought back the person Lucius wanted.

# 03 Father
[[Viper]] recounts his experience when [[Professor Lucius]] "rescued" him from being trafficked for his regenerative capabilities. Lucius initially told Viper that he was his favorite and most perfect child, but as the narrative returns to present day, it's clear that Lucius's interest and expectations have shifted to [[Caleb]]. 

A researcher says:
> "With these high body compatibility rates, Caleb will be our most perfect masterpiece!"

[[Viper]] lashes out at the researcher, and Lucius tells him to stand down, then puts an end to the commotion. Inside the leather suitcase that [[Viper]] brought is the young girl [[Viper]] got from the circus. They let her out.

Viper tries to scare her, expecting Lucius to be proud, but the professor greets her kindly and reassures her. After she leaves and all the researchers are gone, Lucius wipes off his hands (which he used to touch the girl) on a silk handkerchief and throws it away.
* ((Here we see a key indication of Lucius's true character. His apparent kindness is actually manipulative. He expects luxuries, wastes them, and is actually disgusted by the children he claims to "love".))

# 04 Orphan
[[Professor Lucius]] tells [[Viper]] to get in the operating chair, and the mechanical arms begin to repair an injury from setting off explosives at the [[abandoned circus]]. Lucius criticizes Viper for causing too much of a commotion, and for not taking care of his body. 

Viper says he's a coward when pain's involved, and the more of his body is replaced, the less pain he can feel. Lucius counters that currently over 75% of his body is cybernetic replacements, and at a higher replacement rate his brain's ability to maintain self-awareness will continue to erode. Lucius reminds him that there's no place in the family for those who don't contribute.

Viper asks why [[Caleb]] is here now, mentioning that Lucius has been thinking about him for years and remembering when he first saw Caleb four years ago.

# 05 Former Acquaintance
Four years ago (2044), midsummer, in the [[Bloomshore District]] when [[Caleb]] was 21, [[Viper]] reviews his file, confirming that Caleb's parents are unknown and he's enrolled at the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]]-affiliated [[Aerospace Academy]] as a 3rd year student. Viper states that Lucius was interested in Caleb because he was the first person in the past decade to obtain the Special Excellence in Heavy Spacecruiser Certification.

Viper derisively watches [[Caleb]] and [[MC]] chat outside a convenience store, thinking Caleb looks ordinary and assuming MC is his girlfriend. Viper follows him into an alley, expecting to ambush him, but Caleb had already noticed him and ambushed him in return, trapping him with his gravity [[Evol]].

[[Caleb]] is composed and nonchalant, irritating [[Viper]]. There's a sharp contrast between his cold demeanor with Viper and the warm amusement he puts back on to answer a call from MC, who's wondering where he went. He lies about being at a model plane shop, and Viper is furious at being ignored.

Cutting back to 2048, [[Caleb]] is now conscious and [[Viper]] says, "We meet again."
