# Summary

Immediately following the [[Wanderer]] attack on [[Universum Station]], the [[Hunters Association]] detects other simultaneous fluctuations, all originating from [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]. [[MC]] is then sent on a mission there, and instructed to wait for her mission partner due to the danger.

((Given that [[Xavier]] did not actually go to [[Universum Station]] to help her and instead ziplined away, odds are high that he headed directly to [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] using his own understanding of the situation, rather than waiting for orders.))

After waiting several hours, [[MC]] ventures in anyway. She encounters [[Xavier]], then learns that energy fluctuations are causing the space to distort, keeping them trapped in the forest. He deals with the majority of the Wanderers, then decides to not leave her behind. Together, they go to the old signal station and find a [[Flux Nexus]] being used to resurrect an [[Aeonwyrm]].

[[Xavier]] attributes this scheme to [[Onychinus]]. He then instructs MC to use her [[Resonance Evol]] on the [[Flux Nexus]]--this causes a [[modified Protocore]] to emerge. They return to HQ and learn that the modifications are beyond their current understanding of protocores.

[[Jenna]] gives MC a choice of whether to join this mission--it will be dangerous, but her [[Resonance Evol]] could be instrumental. Xavier tries to discourage her from joining, but requests that if she does decide to, she should take him as her mission partner.
