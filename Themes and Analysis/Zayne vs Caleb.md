Zayne and Caleb both fill the "childhood friend" trope. Zayne is the dependable and responsible choice who begins cold and reveals a hidden side of overt affection, while Caleb is a forbidden temptation who begins warm and reveals a hidden side of coldness and conflict.

Note: As of Feb 2025, Caleb does not have an alternate timeline myth. The release of this myth should highlight additional similarities/differences between the characters.
