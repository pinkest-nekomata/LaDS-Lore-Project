The [[Philos]]ian working for [[Ever]] who caused the [[Bloomshore District explosion]]. MC briefly sees him in [[01-04.02 Interlude]], where he injures her with his lightblade Evol. [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]] provides more explicit information, including that [[Ever]] is controlling him by providing the [[philosian drug]].

Key traits:
* Wearing a duckbill cap
* Voice sounds older than he looks
* Wrinkled face and/or hands
* Light Evol
* Similar build to [[Xavier]], but different
* Definitely one of the [[Backtrackers]] that betrayed [[Xavier]]

# Commentary

## Nero's sighting
In [[WU-07 With Light]], security footage shows a hooded figure appearing near a florist's ((likely [[Philo]])) in a flash of light. Notably, the [[Light Evol]] is extremely rare among humans (belonging pretty much just to the [[Backtrackers]]) and the physique generally matches [[Lumiere]]'s. But when he lowers his hood, his face is wrinkled. [[Nero]]'s point of view also states that the build isn't [[Lumiere]]'s at all, indicating it's a different person. Based on the wrinkles, this is likely a reference to the same person as in [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]].

## Could be Isaiah?
[[Passing By]] specifically mentions [[Isaiah]] as having the Light Evol ((all the [[Backtrackers]] do; they were originally part of the [[Order of Lightseekers]])) and being slightly younger/slimmer than [[Xavier]], which matches this description, especially with the info from Nero's sighting. In [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]], the Backtracker Xavier kills mentions "what happened to [[Isaiah]]". If this guy and [[Isaiah]] are indeed the same, then this implies that [[Xavier]] killed [[Isaiah]] after the explosion. However, [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] indicates that there are several [[Backtrackers]] traiters who have been after him, so they could also easily be separate people.
