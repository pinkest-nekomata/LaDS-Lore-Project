A mystical place containing the concept of infinite stories and branching universes. Stories within stories within stories...

It appears in a place that people can visit in [[WU-12 Fractal Library Q&A]] where the [[Administrator]] oversees it, and also features int he [[Tower of Secrets]] myth where [[Zayne - Foreseer]] is its owner and keeper.
