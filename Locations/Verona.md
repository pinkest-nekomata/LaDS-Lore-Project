# Commentary
Though this location is spelled as "Verono" in [[WU-03 Bouquets and Dirges]], this is likely a typo, given that [[Verona]] is used in [[WU-08 Micro Universe#05 Field Trip]] and the real-world location meets the description given in both stories. Alternatively, "Verono" was intended to be a wink at Verona without explicitly using a real-world location. Either way, I think it unlikely that two separate yet similar places with only one letter apart are both connected to [[Rafayel]], so I've decided to unite both references under [[Verona]].
