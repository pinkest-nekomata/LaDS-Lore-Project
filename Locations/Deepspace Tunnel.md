# Spacepedia
In 2034, a spacetime anomaly appeared above [[Linkon]] City. Bound by a gravitational force and filled with an abundance of barely detectable energy and matter, it raised many questions. From that point on, Earth started to see the emergence of alien creatures known as [[Wanderer]]s. This event sparked curiosity throughout human society. Space exploration truly began in earnest, significantly advancing research in this field.

# Wormhole
[[03-C Voyage of the Outcast - 04]] gives this additional theoretical explanation of the Deepspace Tunnel:

> Xavier: In theory, the Morris-Thorne wormhole is a traversable wormhole. It is spherically symmetrical and features a "throat" that bridges two black holes. The "throat" is a finite spherical region, containing negative energy density matter to counteract gravitational forces inside the wormhole...
> *As Xavier speaks in a measured tone, the stars shift under his touch to gradually form a wormhole model. The lights from distant planets flicker before us, and his silhouette seemingly stretches across light years. \[...]*
> Dr Ulysses: Correct. The negative energy's repulsive gravitational properties keep the wormhole's throat open, allowing matter or signals to pass through. Time travel becomes possible with this model. For example, the Deepspace Tunnel above us might very well be a giant wormhole. The mysterious Deepspace signals could then make their way to our distant Earth. Perhaps certain materials or even other forms of live can find us through these cosmic channels...
