[[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] takes place in late summer to fall 2049.
# Season
[[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] specifically takes place in fall after the school year has begun, meaning it can't be earlier than September and could also theoretically take place in October or November. It's not specifically stated, but enough time has passed that the year must be 2049.

## Potential retcon
Note that until [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] specified the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] as occurring when there's snow on the ground in 2048 (i.e. Nov or Dec) the more natural assumption would be that the season would be spring (Feb/March).

This comes from it initially appearing that the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] wasn't long after MC became a hunter in June/July. If the explosion were in July/Aug, then [[Hunting Day]] would be in Jan/Feb/Mar, so [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] would be in Mar/Apr/May. This is still in spring, and aligns with the season given to [[Captivating Moment]], as discussed below.

However, since [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] specifically happens in Sep/Oct/Nov, the extra time had to be accounted for.
# Duration
[[03-A Thorns Under the Moon]] depicts a day, a 3 day time skip, a day, then another 3 day time skip for a total duration of 8 days.

[[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] and [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]] each include a day, a 3 day time skip, and another day for a total duration of 5 days each.

This is 18 days total, plus another day for the events of [[03-01.03 Onward Again]] and [[03-01.04 No Ends]], for a minimum of 19 days duration. If you decide to include [[Captivating Moment]] here, as seems intended, that adds another 3 days for 21.

Concluding [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] as having lasted about a month seems fair and provides some wiggle room.

MC describes the time from the end of [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]] to the start of [[04 Homecoming Wings]] as a "few months". With the initial 2 month time skip and the 1 month for the branches, this would be at minimum 3 months, and perhaps up to 4.

# Captivating Moment
Though the [[Captivating Moment]] myth came out concurrent with Sylus's release in July 2024, and [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] released Sep thru Dec 2024, [[Captivating Moment]] refers to [[MC]] looking for clues about an [[Aether Core]] after her initial return from the [[N109 Zone]].

[[Operation Aether Ordeal]] starts almost immediately upon her return from the N109 Zone ([[03-01.01 Imbalance]]), and two months pass before [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]], and then another month (or maybe two) passes before [[04 Homecoming Wings]]. So, [[Captivating Moment]] almost certainly occurs during this window. The writers would have to at least know the broad strokes of [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]].

This is interesting because we might assume that the [[Aether Core]] MC mentions here is the same one that she got in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], but that Aether Core is already resolved, meaning it must be the [[Spatium Core]]. Of course, there's a possibility that there will be future [[Aether Core]]s to find, but for right now the [[Spatium Core]] seems most likely.

All of this is important because [[Captivating Moment]] specifically takes place in spring, seeming to hint that [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] happens in the spring. And, notably, if you assume the time skip before [[01-04.01 Family]] to be less than a month, [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] would indeed be happening in spring.

But, say, if the writers of [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] specified that it happened in autumn, thus throwing off the overall timeline, you might release another story like [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] specifically lengthening that vague time skip so that [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] occurs in autumn.

In all that, [[Captivating Moment]] seems to get lost in the shuffle. Fortunately, it's a minor continuity error from [[Captivating Moment]]'s perspective--they only admire the foliage for a brief moment, and it can just as easily be the fall leaves starting to change or the late summer green vs spring flowers.
