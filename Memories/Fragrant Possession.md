**Description**
> I'm about to attend an award ceremony honoring the Rising Deepspace Hunter, and Zayne has started training me...

# Summary
MC has been nominated for the [[Rising Deepspace Hunter Award]]. Zayne is immensely proud and helps her prepare for her acceptance speech. On the day of the ceremony, they take an early flight from [[Linkon]] to [[Dawnlight City]]. While they check into their hotel before the ceremony, a [[Wanderer]] attacks. MC deals with the [[Wanderer]] while Zayne tends to the wounded. They continue to help with cleanup as the Deepspace Hunter Award ceremony begins. MC wins the award, and Zayne acts as facilitator and cameraman so she can call in and give her speech. 

Back in [[Linkon]], MC does a PR interview about the award accompanied by a themed photoshoot, which provides them ethereal spring outfits as a gift. After the photoshoot, college students (hunter trainees) ask for photos with MC. Zayne gets a little jealous, and they head for a quieter place, running to stay ahead of the rain. The kindled scene depicts them taking shelter in a pavilion.

# Key Info
* MC appeared on the cover of [[Dawnlight Weekly]] with a picture from the award ceremony and the headline, "Rising Star On The Front Lines: The First Deepspace Hunter to Receive an Award While Fighting." Zayne bought twenty copies. Ten from the magazine stand at the airport, and ten more online.
	* Zayne says the copies are for [[Greyson]], [[Yvonne]], [[Dr. Riley]], [[Dr. Noah]], and [[Zayne's parents]]. Plus extras.
* The reporter that organizes the interview is [[Leighna]], from [[PANOrama]].
* The photoshoot takes place at a [[vintage villa]] that's now a memorial hall after it served as a temporary medical shelter during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].
* MC eventually brings out a possessive side to Zayne. She confesses her own possessiveness, and they agree to each no longer hold back.

# Trivia
* MC previously helped Zayne rehearse a speech.
* MC won a [[Mr. Seal]] plushie at a carnival ( #todo memory reference?) and it sits in the audience
	* Fleecy, Happy Snowman, and Astro Penguin are also there
	* MC caught Fleecy with Zayne for a young patient (this is the in-game tutorial for the crane game) and the other two plushies are Zayne's exclusive plushies.
* When Zayne had to rehearse speeches before, he had to create his temporary audience--i.e. he made little snow sculptures
* Zayne is a firm believer in revisiting the familiar to discover something new.
* Zayne is an expert at finding delicious food wherever he goes.
* Tara gets her copy of MC's [[Dawnlight Weekly]] from Zayne.
* Zayne is willing to wear more flamboyant clothes as long as it's part of a couple's outfit.

# Quotes

> Zayne: Getting distracted in front of your teacher... I see, someone wants to be bold today.

> MC: You better prepare yourself. If I win, the cameras might catch me running into your arms.
> Zayne: We should practice that now, just to be safe.

> MC: I believe that no matter what challenges await, my dedication to being a Deepspace Hunter will give me the courage to face anything. It's because I have someone who exemplifies these qualities. Although we work in different fields, watching his dedication has helped me find my own path forward. Thank you.

> MC: You can also be impatient, Dr. Zayne?
> Zayne: I don't have as much patience as you think.

> Zayne: It's not me. You're the variable here. My changes involve you.

> Zayne: I want the eyes I love to see only me.

> Zayne: I only just discovered this side of myself too.

> Zayne: I want to be infused with your floral scent... to possess the same fragrance as you. Or perhaps... I want to let it take me.

> Zayne: I didn't mean to keep you all to myself. \[...] Whether it's winning awards and gaining recognition, appearing on magazine covers, or becoming a role model for the next generation... No one could be happier or prouder than me. But sometimes, I find myself torn between wanting everyone to see my treasure... and wishing fewer people would look your way. Isn't it a perplexing contradiction? I've never felt this way before.

> Zayne: This treasure wants to be the only one in your eyes.

> MC: I want to see every side of Zayne that reveals itself because of me. And what I saw today... I really like it.
> Zayne: I'll show you everything you like. And I won't hold back.
