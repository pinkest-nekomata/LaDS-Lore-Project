# Summary
MC descends into foggy, chaotic nightmares. When she awakes, she's in a valley of blooming datura, holding a huge horned creature as it dies. She tries to remember what happened after that bload-soaked night where they exchanged half their souls, but she it's all shredded fragments.

In the chapel, the bell tolls. She plays the [[requiem]] for him, but can't remember if she finished it. ((See also [[Continuous Symphony]]))

Sometimes, she believes she never left the chapel. In these happy dreams, they build a quiet life together, and he even takes her to a valley of blooming datura, showing her a side of himself she didn't know existed.

But then there is the nightmare--where the Fiend is declared dead and she holds the secret of his survival. Chained at the [[Sanctuary]]--the first one they destroyed--he visits her each night, but only she can see him. They speak of dreams, then make a promise to never betray each other.

## Commentary

# Details
> The night fog envelops me, and I feel like I'm trapped in a long, chaotic nightmare.
> When I wake up, I'm surrounded by a red valley filled with blooming [[datura]].
> My arms feel heavy. I look down and see a huge horned creature. I hold it as it dies.
> I don't know why I'm here. I just vaguely remember having a dragon in a pitch-[[black chapel]].
> I try desperately to recall, but the last clear memory I have of the dragon ends on that blood-soaked night under the moon.
> Everything afterward feels like shredded fragments, incomplete and scattered.
> It's like hearing half of a chord meant to be played with both hands.
> Like a dance that was supposed to be for two, with only one left to dance it alone.
> Maybe I'm imagining things. But after half of our souls are exchanged, I've been dreaming of him more and more--sometimes, even while awake.
> When I'm alone, I always see him by my side.
> Those visions... I can't tell if they really happened, if they're just my own fantasies, or if they're his.
> Or maybe I'm seeing... the other half of his soul that's within me.

In the [[black chapel]], she remembers more of that night. (Presumably before they fell asleep.)

> Sylus: Why are you so worried? I just want to rest. I won't die.
> MC: In your current state, you might not wake up at all!
> `The church bell tolls once.`
> Sylus: That song you played... It'd be nice if I could hear it again.
> MC: ... `(Footsteps.)`
> `The church bell tolls and the organ plays.`
> *The black chapel is like an illusion steeped in darkness. I can't remember if I finished playing that piece. But it's a [[requiem]]. A song meant for the departed.*


## Dreams
> Sometimes I think we never truly left the chapel after that night.
> I live there with the dragon. We keep each other company, and we live a peaceful life away from everyone.
> On days when we tended to our wounds, we'd go hunting in the forest or disguise ourselves to shop at the market.
> Little by little, the chapel became filled with traces of us. On the pew, there'd be the salve I mixed for his wounds the night before. By the stained glass, the sheath he made for my sword hangs proudly.
* ((Traces motif, see also #todo the Pile it Up memory))
> Slowly... it feels like we've truly made a home here together.

> MC: Hang this one a little higher. And be careful with this. Don't let your horns get caught on--Hey!
> *I feel my body become weightless. Sylus had encircled his arms around my waist and lifted me. He puts me on his shoulder. My view rises in a flash, and I widen my eyes, looking down to meet his gaze.*
> Sylus: What? Didn't you say it should be hung higher?
> *His eyes gleam with amusement. I can't help but smile too. We're more in sync than I thought. When I raise a hand, he moves smoothly, keeping one arm steady around my waist. He doesn't falter.
> I hang up each decoration from the pile on the pew, one after another. As I reach inside my bag again, my fingers brush the only item that's left.*
> MC: Here's the last one. But this one's different.
> *I tilt my head and raise my chin toward Sylus.*
> MC: Close your eyes.
> Sylus: Hmm?
> *He looks up. He's slightly confused but doesn't question me. Instead, he obediently closes his eyes. Sunlight caresses his hair and makes it look soft and fluffy. Smiling, I carefully placed the flower crown I prepared on his head.*
> MC: I wasn't expecting much... But it suits you well.
> *Sylus opens his eyes. Hesitant, he raises his hand to touch the upturned petals and gently adjusts them.*
> Sylus: So you stayed up late these past few nights to make this?
> MC: ...You didn't sleep either?
> *He chuckles without responding, reaching up to pluck a tiny petal that's gotten caught in my hair.*
> Sylus: Do you like flowers?
> MC: Yes, I guess. But there aren't a lot in Tarus City. I had to scour the entire woods to get this much.
> Sylus: The forest barely has any flowers.
> MC: What do you mean--
> Sylus: Hold on tight.
> *Before I can finish, Sylus wraps his arms around my waist and lifts me. The air brushes past us. He lets out a hearty laugh as he spreads his wings.*
> Sylus: Since you gave me a gift, I should respond in kind.

Kindled scene from Abyssal Blossom.

They glide through the air.

> Sylus: Watch your step O Great Sorceress. We've arrived.

As he lands, the gem in his chest gleams. She looks at him, but he nods out at the valley. The hills roll gently into the distance, lined with soft grass and endless red [[datura]] flowers.

> MC: I thought there wouldn't be a place like this in Tarus City.
> Sylus: What did you think Tarus City was like?

He sits in the grass behind her, one knee propped up and his elbow resting on it. She kneels down next to him.
> MC: the city is similar to its ruler. Nothing but desire and blood.
> Sylus: Well, you should have developed a new impression by now.

He takes her wrist and guides her into his lap.

> Sylus: Just because you haven't seen the other sides of it doesn't mean they don't exist.

She takes his chin, evaluating him.
> MC: Then I need to take a closer look. What else haven't I seen?

He scoffs and grabs her hand, though not roughly.
> Sylus: Have your fill? Seen enough?

He leans back and lies on the grass, pulling her over him.
> Sylus: Wouldn't you say this angle is better?

A stray petal lands over his right eye.

> MC: Too bad I can't see it all. However...

She leans closer and blows the petal off his face. His breath trembles.

> Sylus: ...You're quite daring.
> MC: I can be even bolder.

She plucks a flower and tucks it against his horn.

> MC: Flowers suit you better than Tarus City.
> Sylus: That's the first time someone said those words to me.
* ((Another relationship motif.))

She places another in the scales of his left shoulder.

> Sylus: Only you and this flower... can touch me here.

He takes the last flower from her hand and puts it in her hair, then cups her cheek with his hand, gently shaking her head. In revenge, she grabs his cheek and rubs/grabs at it. He pushes over her and they roll through the grass until she lands on top again. She pins his right hand with her left.

> Sylus: You know, Tarus City can have flowers bloom everywhere, as far as the eye can see.

He raises his free left hand to brush her cheek with the back of his fingers. She leans down over him.

> Sylus: But only for one person.

She closes the distance, and they kiss.


## Nightmares

> On the other side of that nightmare, the dragon never took me to the valley where flowers bloomed.
> On the night we exchanged souls, the [[Sacred Judicator]] himself led the entire [[Legion of Justitia]] to surround the [[black chapel]].
> They spared no effort trying to capture the severely injured dragon. The mark the dragon left on my shoulder served as undeniable proof of me being a "sorceress".
> The news of the Fiend's death spreads throughout the land. On that day, I'm taken back to the [[Ivory City]] under the accusation of being a sorceress. They imprison me in the courtyard behind the ruined Sanctuary. Now I can only wait to be sent to the Court of Justitia.
> The Sanctuary is cold and bleak. The cat, which has never managed to climb over the courtyard walls, has put on ten pounds. It seems to have grown accustomed to life behind these walls, bound by invisible threads.
* (("Invisible threads" is a callback to her time as the "princess", the life others wanted her to live.))
> Only I know my dragon is still alive. 
> He flies across the Abyss to find me on every moonlit night. This is a secret that only I can see.

The background shifts to a courtyard in the Sanctuary. There are two dragon statues flanking a stone altar. ((This is the platform mentioned. There aren't supposed to be any dragons at the Sanctuary, so this is likely a mild continuity error.))

> *Under the moonlit sky, Sylus sits on a weathered platform between two statues. As the sound of crunching grass reaches his ears, he turns his head.*
> Sylus: You're awake. Or were you struggling to fall asleep?
> *Chains drag through the overgrown grass as I walk toward him, reaching out my hand. He gently pulls me up and holds me in his arms.*
> Sylus: I've been feeling... restless. I suspect it's because half of someone's soul is being noisy in my body again.
> MC: Hmph. That's a good thing.
> *Sylus quickly brings his legs together and blocks my movement.*
> Sylus: Don't move.
> *He carefully dries my dew-soaked hair with a silk handkerchief. HIs voice had taken on a more solemn tone, as if he's grapplig with a matter of great significance. I stay nestled in his arms. When I lower my head, I see his curled-up tail. The dragon's tail coils around my ankle. Even the deepest wound on its tip has almost completely healed.*
> MC: I fell asleep waiting for you these past few nights. Why didn't you wake me up?
> *As the silk handkerchief absorbs the moisture at the ends of my hair, Sylus allows me to turn my head. A gentle smile graces his lips.*
> Sylus: Someone was dreaming and continued to say my name--
> MC: Hey...!
> *I lift his chin and scrutinize him.
> With a relaxed grace, the corners of Sylus's mouth curl up. He nuzzles my fingers.*
> Sylus: Did you actually dream of me?
> MC: ...Have you never dreamed of me?
> *He doesn't speak. He just looks at me.*
> Sylus: Before I was sealed away, I did dream of you. I just didn't expect I'd be willing to dry that person's hair one day.
> MC: ...And you also happen to be enjoying it. So what did I do in your dream exactly? Did I point a sword at you?
> *The candlelight flickers alongside something else in Sylus's gaze.*
> Sylus: What about you? What did I do in your dream?
> MC: I...
> *The boy from my dreams appears before me again. Under the moonlight, the horns and tail of the Fiend reflect a dim glow. I meet his gaze. Numerous words bubble up within me, yet they become entangled on the tip of my tongue. On this dimly lit night, I hold him close and pour all my strength into hugging him.*
> MC: Since you've taken half of my soul... Even if the world turns its back on you, I'll always stand by your side. You're not even allowed to think about leaving me.
> *My heartbeat resounds like a drum in my ears as Sylus lowers his head. He rests his chin on my shoulder.*
> Sylus: Alright.
> *The candlelight washes the moon's glow in a warm hue. I lay my head on his arm and entwine my fingers with his, reaching out to grasp the light together.*
> MC: Let's make a pinky promise.
> Sylus: Hmm?
> MC: To never betray each other.
> Sylus: Our souls are bound. We will never betray each other even if Doomsday arrives outside this Sanctuary. Even if the world crumbles.
> MC: This promise can't be broken.
> Sylus: This promise will never be broken.
