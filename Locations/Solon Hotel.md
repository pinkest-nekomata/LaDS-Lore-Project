Situated at the heart of the [[N109 Zone]], this luxury hotel serves as a venue for banquets and local transactions. On its rooftop, the remnants of abandoned collectors transport tubes, and other devices lie scattered. Once a place where [[Ever]] conducted experiments, it is now abandoned and devoid of activity.

# Other Info

 #todo confirm whether this is the location of events during Long Awaited Revelry? This is the roof with the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] right above it?

[[Sylus]] has a permanent luxury suite here. ([[WU-10 Mischief#02 Rumor]])
