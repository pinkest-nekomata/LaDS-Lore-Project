# Summary

MC learns that the painting is by [[Rafayel]], a celebrity artist. His manager [[Thomas]] owns a gallery called [[Flux Arts]] in the [[central business district]], and seeing Thomas is the best way to try to talk to Rafayel. MC also recognizes Rafayel as the person from [[01-01.07 Ripples]].

The next day, MC heads over to [[Flux Arts]]. [[Thomas]] is busy, so she explores the gallery. When she stops by a painting called [[The Day of Ebbing]], [[Rafayel]]'s AI describes the [[Lemurian]] phenomenon (though she doesn't yet know it's Lemurian).

# Details

[[MC]] and [[Raymond's painting]] return to HQ. [[Tara]] reports that only a small amount of [[Metaflux]] could be extracted, so analysis may take a while. However, she was able to determine the source of the painting--a gallery called [[Flux Arts]] owned by [[Thomas]], a professional art broker. The artist is [[Rafayel]].

MC and Tara go through more details about the artist (see [[Rafayel]] for key quotes). MC sees a picture of him and realizes he's "that rambling weirdo with the fish".

The next day, MC heads over to [[Flux Arts]] to deal with [[Thomas]]. But since he's occupied with an emergency, she wanders around herself and interacts with an AI of [[Rafayel]] that can answer questions. The specific painting is [[The Day of Ebbing]], which the AI describes.
