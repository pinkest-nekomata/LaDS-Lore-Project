**In the game this is *Feathers STAR*.** 
I've used "Feathers Planet" here because it is a more appropriate localization and I was gonna confuse the crap out of myself if I kept seeing "star" when it's a "planet". This is because in CN the words for "star" and "planet" are the same, see also [[celestial bodies in CN]].
