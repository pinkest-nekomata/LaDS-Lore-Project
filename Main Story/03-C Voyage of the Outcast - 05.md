# Summary
In the research center, [[MC]], [[Xavier]] and [[Ulysses]] learn that the [[RMFMA]]'s data has been intentionally tampered with. They can confirm a [[Wanderer]] was there in the past two weeks, but nothing more.

[[Xavier]]'s clearance for the device and knowledge of it are suspicious, but attention quickly shifts to the realization that a study event for freshmen was held recently--and it's the same five students who were attacked. The sixth student, [[Soren]], the Vice President, becomes immediately suspicious.

They head over to the [[Prestara University Deepspace Exploration Research Center]] where the [[RMFMA]] is housed on the third floor, under a skylight.

While [[MC]] talks with [[Ulysses]] and wonders how they'll get clearance, [[Xavier]] has already checked the device (indicating he has valid credentials) and found that all the data relating to the [[Wanderer]] is corrupted. It showed that a Wanderer appeared on campus within the past two weeks, but otherwise the data is useless.

MC is surprised not only that Xavier has clearance, but also that he knows so much about the device. She confronts him, but he lies and says it's just easier than it looks. Ulysses returns and confirms Xavier's conclusion that the data's corrupted and was deliberately tampered with--but only a small handful of people have access to the new and well-secured lab.

Xavier's questioning reveals that there was a study event for new students which included a tour of the lab. MC quickly confirms online that the five students who were attacked are the same five who were on this special study event. There was a sixth student--[[Soren]], Vice President of the student council. They find it suspicious that he wasn't also attacked.

On the way out of the lab, [[MC]] sees an old photo yellowed with age that includes [[Xavier]].
