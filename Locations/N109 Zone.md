Once a bustling technology hub, it is now one of the most dangerous areas after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] occurred. Surrounded by other [[No-Hunt Zone]]s, it has evolved into a lawless land where danger and opportunity coexist. It is rife with violence and crime.
With illicit trade and dangerous research, many of its activities are related to [[Protocore]]s and [[Wanderer]]s. Its many benefits have driven countless outlaws to risk their lives.

**Origin of the name**: The N109 Zone, also known as [[No-Hunt Zone]] No. 109, does not belong to the 108 regions designated officially as no-hunt zones by the [[Hunters Association]]. Prolonged energy fluctuations and dangerous Wanderers are characteristic of a no-hunt zone. The [[Wanderer]] threat in the N109 Zone has been suppressed, but its inherent dangers persist due to the complex web of factions and poor living conditions. Consequently, it has earned the reputation of being "No-Hunt Zone No. 109" because it's difficult to enter and is even more dangerous than a typical no-hunt zone.

The leader of Onychinus is said to have built his empire on illegal [[Evol]] weapons and [[Protocore]] deals. He's the most influential, dominant figure in the [[N109 Zone]]. However, he hasn't been seen for a while.
