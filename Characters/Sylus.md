# Spacepedia
The leader of [[Onychinus]] is said to have built his empire on illegal [[Evol]] weapons and [[Protocore]] deals. He's the most influential, dominant figure in the [[N109 Zone]]. However, he hasn't been seen for a while.

# Timeline
## Philos
In [[Beyond Cloudfall]], Sylus is said to have been sealed in the abyss in a time before humans ruled Philos. (This may be an unreliable legend.) 1,677 years later, [[Sorceress MC]] frees him. This appears to be during a time after immortality is common on Philos, and legends of Doomsday are popular and associated with dragons.

They do some space pirating together before that life meets a tragic end. Sylus "dies" to prevent himself from killing MC due to his fated madness, but MC curses his soul to be forever bound to hers--only she can give him a true death. This makes him functionally immortal.

An unspecified number of years later, when inter-planetery travel around Philos is common, Sylus ends up in (then out of) [[space-time prison]] as the system's most wanted criminal. After taking over [[Feathers Planet]], he finds the [[Eye of Aether]] which allows him to discover [[MC]]'s location and he heads for the [[N109 Zone]].

Presumably, he also traveled through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] as [[Xavier]] did. Their being foils for each other reinforces this idea that they both traveled back in time in similar ways, see also [[Xavier vs. Sylus]].

## N109 Zone
Sylus arrives in the [[N109 Zone]] after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. By 2036, everyone in the zone knows his name and he's established [[Onychinus]] as a primarily solo venture ([[WU-14 Elysium]]).

Initially, three main factions vied for power. Tensions came to a head with the appearance of a [[Protocore map]] which kicked off the [[2036 Disaster]] during which 1/3 of the zone's population "vanished". Amidst rumors that Sylus was "eating people" (aka devouring them with his power) the bloody conflict spilled over months.

In the end, [[Sylus]] emerged the lone victor. Due to a deal he made with [[Ginevra]] for the [[Protocore map]], he ensured that [[Elysium]] (and its operator [[Aislinn]]) remained unscathed and has been the intel bar's sponsor ever since.

In 2046, 2 years before the main story timeline, he meets [[Luke and Kieran]] and they pry their way into his good graces. [[Sherman]] is already a peacock at this point, and [[Luke and Kieran]] volunteer to keep an eye on them. The twins are 16 at the time. ([[WU-10 Mischief]]).

By the time MC enters the [[N109 Zone]] (approx February 2049, see [[Main Story Timeline]]) Sylus hasn't been seen "for a while" to the point that many people thought he was dead. What he was doing in that time remains unclear, though we know that [[Mephisto]] was watching [[MC]] at [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] 6.5-7 months prior ([[01-03.08 Where Light Vanishes]]), so he may have been focused on tracking her progress.

As of approx Feb 2049, Sylus has regained control of the [[N109 Zone]]. But by this point, the area outside the zone is more dangerous. [[Xavier]] notes this before she heads in ([[01-08.07 Stellar Guidance]]). ((The change may relate to the fluctations caused by the [[Aether Core]] at the [[Flux Nexus]] beneath the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] during [[02-02.12 Resonance's Power]]))

# Sincerity
A minor recurring theme, mentioned here and there including in [[Land of Lost]] and [[Grassland Romance]].

# Greek names
Sylus's lore pulls frequently from greek lore and names.
* Sylus is a spelling of Silas, an name of greek origin ([Behind The Name](https://www.behindthename.com/name/silas))
* Mephisto is a shortened form of Mephistopholes, a corrupted greek compound and the name of the demon in the story of Faust form german folklore ([[Mephisto#Name's origin]])
* [[Elysium]] is named after the place heroic souls go to rest in the Greek Underworld, which is ruled by Hades
* Tartarus is a recurring theme:
	* [[Tarus]] City's name is noted in-game to derive from an old reference to the Abyss, confirming it's meant to evoke Tartarus
	* In promo content for [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], the [[space-time prison]] is called Tartarus
	* Tartarus is the [[Praedator]] name of Sylus's character in the [[Tomorrow's Catch 22 AU]]
