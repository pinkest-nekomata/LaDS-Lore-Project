> "Every sunrise is accompanied by a sunset. Likewise, the Sea God slumbers and awakens with the ebb and flow of his power. But when his power is gone, he fades away and dissolves into the sea."

The ancient civilization of [[Lemuria]] has had many Sea Gods over time, and a few of these are depicted in [[Tears of Romirro]]. That myth also makes it clear that [[Rafayel]] is the last of the Sea Gods. See also [[Tome of the Sea God]].

As shown in [[03-B Land of Secret Flames - 11]] and [[Tears of Romirro]], the Sea God's power has a "personality" of its own that can conflict with and override the desires of the individual channeling that power. Accessing this power requires meeting certain conditions to be a "true" sea god.

In [[Destined Dawntide]], Rafayel discusses a relief of the first sea god, talking about how he brought coral branches and conchs when he proposed to his bride.

From [[Destined Dawntide]]:
* Rafayel: Sometimes, only a few years pass between a [[Sea God]]'s passing and their successor's birth. Other times, it can take centuries."
