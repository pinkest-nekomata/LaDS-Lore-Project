Key traits:
* Wearing a duckbill cap
* Voice sounds older than he looks
* Wrinkled face and/or hands
* Light Evol
* Similar build to [[Xavier]], but different
* Definitely one of the [[Backtrackers]] that betrayed [[Xavier]]

# Commentary
[[Passing By]] specifically mentions [[Isaiah]] as having the Light Evol and being slightly younger/slimmer than [[Xavier]], which matches this description. He's definitely responsible for the explosion in [[01-04.03 Within Reach]]. In [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]], the Backtracker Xavier kills mentions "what happened to [[Isaiah]]". If this guy and [[Isaiah]] are indeed the same, then this implies that [[Xavier]] killed [[Isaiah]] after the explosion. But, I need to double check against the [[Shooting Stars]] myth and Prologue to Tomorrow for more clues. #todo
