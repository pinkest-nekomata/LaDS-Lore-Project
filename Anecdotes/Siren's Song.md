# Anecdote
Relevant LI: [[Rafayel]]
Main POV character: [[Rafayel]], [[Talia]], [[Louis]]
Associated Companion: [[Rafayel - Phantom of the Siren]]

Rafayel was an opera singer named Mo in [[Verona]] before he came to [[Linkon]] City.

## Summary
Going by the name Mo, [[Rafayel]] performs in an opera about a siren and their victim. During the performance, a [[Mr. Fallon]] dies mysteriously with a smile on his face.

A private detective, [[Louis]], tries to find a way to prove that [[Rafayel]] was responsible. Meanwhile, [[Rafayel]] has moved on to other business trying to see after the [[Lemurian]] survivors, meeting with his aunt [[Talia]] and reflecting on the [[Seamoon Ceremony]] of his relative [[K]].

Ultimately, he gets a lead on [[MC]]'s location, so he leaves [[Verona]] and heads to [[Linkon]] City. The events of [[Addictive Pain]] occur directly after this anecdote.

## Commentary
This story uses a lot of symbolism and motifs that should be read with Rafayel's myths ([[Forgotten Sea]] and [[Sea of Golden Sand]]) in mind. It plays with who is the siren vs the victim, casting their relationship in different lights. Due to the use of symbolism, I've transcribed the relevant passages fully so it's easier to continue to analyze them.

A few key aspects of Rafayel's character emerge here. He's haunted by the [[Lemurian disaster]], and lonely in his efforts to restore [[Lemuria]] (as hinted by Talia's perspective and the chapter title "One-Man Show"). He's generally cold and unphased, but the only thing that piques his interest is clues about [[MC]]'s whereabouts.

We get more or less explicit confirmation that [[Rafayel]] can kill with a song. And while no direct motive for [[Mr. Fallon]]'s murder is revealed, we get other hints at [[Rafayel]] getting rid of people who might threaten the [[Lemurian]]s in [[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures#06 Audio File No.5 Conflict]] (including the [[Sea Monster Murders]]) and with [[Raymond]]'s death.

And one last little tidbit--[[Rafayel]] travels by ship at the end because he's afraid of airplanes. ([[In-Depth Interview - Rafayel]])

# 01 Cliffhanger
It is the 10th anniversary performance of the Royal Opera House.

The narration describes the events of an opera where [[Rafayel]] is playing the character Maverick:
> Maverick finally arrives at the beach. The Siren who deceived him sits ont he rocks. She turns around, smiling amidst the fragmented waves.
> His bloodline that spanned 100 [sic] years has met its end, its family crest stained with the blood of loved ones. The Siren is responsible. He cherished her, yet she dug out their hearts with her own hands.
> He wades through the shallow water and climbs onto the rocks. His hands are marred with scars.
> These bloody hands had once cradled the girl's face, gently caressing her exquisitely sculpted features.
> But her love is a web meticulously woven with lies.
> The seawater wets Maverick's clothes as he slowly opens his mouth, singing a melodious love song to his former lover.
> It is the song she taught him, a siren's ballad.
> His voice fluctuates from deep below the waves to soaring high above the skies, from sunset to moonrise, from high tide to low tide.
> He sings with such passion that even the Siren is captivated by his enchanting voice. Step by step, he approaches her, caressing the bloodstains on her face that have yet to be washed away. He embraces her, whispering tenderly in her ear as he reveals the hidden dagger concealed in his sleeve. He plunges it into her heart when the song reaches its climax.
* ((100 years is quite short for a bloodline, so I think this is a typo. Perhaps 1000 or 10,000 years? #todo check if there's a note about bloodline length in [[Forgotten Sea]].))

The curtains close, and there's effusive praise for [[Rafayel]]'s performance. But then the cheers are cut by a scream, and it's revealed that a [[Mr. Fallon]] has died in his VIP box.

Backstage, [[Rafayel]] is relieved to be done singing, while "a searing pain throbs in his throat."
* ((This could be the strain of singing, but more likely, it's meant to be that feeling of deep grief and sadness, especially when there's an urge to cry but you can't/won't.))

He then puts on a new satin tie, "like sheathing a blade", and quietly slips back out onto the carpeted stage behind the curtain.

[[Louis]], a private detective, is also at the performance. He sneaks onto the stage to observe the scene, nothing that [[Mr. Fallon]] has such a smile on his face that he looks like a sculpture. Louis notices "someone" else on the stage behind the curtain ([[Rafayel]]) but only catches a glimpse of him leaving.

# 02 Stage Manager
[[Rafayel]] is at a cafe in the heart of [[Verona]]. Nearby, students are gossiping about the *Siren's Voice* was performance, saying, "A person enchanted by the siren's ballad will ultimately die with a smile" and "[[Mr. Fallon]] had no external injuries or signs of poisoning." Also:
> "Maybe that opera singer really is the God of the Sea. He took his revenge."
> "I heard his name is Mo..."
* As readers, we are meant to take these statements as fact, especially since from [[Forgotten Sea]] we already know he *is* the [[Sea God]]. [[Rafayel]], going by the name Mo, used his [[Lemurian]] powers to kill [[Mr. Fallon]] with the performance. Given his lack of surprise at the events that unfold, it's likely that the murder was targeted.

[[Talia]] arrives, revealing that she's [[Rafayel]]'s aunt. She's brought documents that [[Rafayel]] asked for. He's in a bit of a mood, and she tries to break the ice.
> "I watched your performance that day too."
> Rafayel still doesn't look up. "Yeah."
> "Have you gotten used to [[Verona]] yet?"
> "It doesn't matter. I'm just here for now."

Looking at the papers, he jots down names so hard he almost breaks the paper. She's unsure what to say, and muses:
> After that incident in [[Lemuria]], Rafayel changed. Talia felt she could no longer recognize him. If the Rafayel of the past was a blazing flame, then the Rafayel now resembled a reef battered by relentless waves--outwardly cold and hard, yet riddled with cracks, vulnerable to crumbling from the next wave.

Rafayel goes to leave, but Talia stops him, suggesting that he get back into painting, which he used to like. There's an upcoming exhibition. She gives a vague reference to how [[Rafayel]] is still trying to take care of the [[Lemurian]]s, which they also discuss in [[WU-03 Bouquets and Dirges#02 Wedding]]. After a long silence, Rafayel reveals:
> [[K]] is dead. We held the [[Seamoon Ceremony]] for him last Saturday.

Talia is shocked, and Rafayel says "Not every [[Lemurian]] survivor can wait," on the verge of tears. Talia realizes "they only have each other as family now." She doesn't know what to do or say, and Rafayel leaves alone.

# 03 The Fourth Wall
Outside the cafe, [[Louis]] reflects on how [[Mr. Fallon]]'s death was ruled an illness and the investigation was hurriedly closed by the police. But the deceased's family paid [[Louis]] to keep investigating. He reveals that [[Talia]] is a renowned soprano in her own right, who has no known relatives or lovers.

As [[Rafayel]] leaves the cafe, [[Louis]] tails him into an alley, where Rafayel confronts him.

# 04 Improv
Later, they dine together at a restaurant. [[Louis]] promises to leave him alone if he answers a few questions. He shares that his favorite myth is *The Killer Song*, but it's been altered over time. ((He's clearly trying to nudge about the mysterious murder.)) Rafayel says he has "no interest in writing fairy tales." Then [[Louis]] shares his favorite version:

> Legends say the Siren was not a graceful woman but a charming, handsome merman. Contrary to the stories in operas, he met a woman on the beach, but she took his tail and cut off his scales. At death's door, the Siren sang a mournful elegy. Ultimately, the woman on the shore passed away with a smile as he sang.
* ((Here, the writers have a chance to hint at another angle of Rafayel and [[MC]]'s relationship. Indeed, the siren in this case is a merman--Rafayel. "She took his tail and cut off his scales" can be interpreted as a reference to forcing him to live on land--which is exactly what happened after the [[Lemurian disaster]] in [[Forgotten Sea]].))
* Another important parallel is to [[Raymond's painting]]. When [[MC]] is swept into the vision, she sees a "girl by the shore", her lower half in the water, "crying and laughing at the same time", while a mournful song is heard in the background.

Rafayel seems unaffected. [[Louis]] says that version is "too plain", so he rewrote it. ((This is both a chance for him to try to get a reaction out of Rafayel regarding the murder, as well as a chance for the writers to give us more clues.))

> People lured by the siren's ballad don't die peacefully. Their smiles are just a mask bestowed by the Siren. Instead, as they near death, they witness bizarre visions as they're plunged into endless torment. A blue pattern, representing the Siren, appears on their chests. It's a constant reminder of the sins they committed against the sea.
* ((This has strong parallels to [[Raymond]]'s death, which happens later. We know that [[Raymond's painting]] essentially contains the siren's ballad (which [[MC]] hears), that he was driven slowly mad, and that he ultimately ended up carving a fish scale pattern into himself--perhaps in an effort to remove this blue pattern that appeared.))

Rafayel remains unimpressed, so [[Louis]] continues.

> The Siren returns to the sea, believing everything has ended. But he discovers his underwater kingdom turned to ruins soaked in blood. His people have either vanished, turned into bloody foam, or were kidnapped. HIs homeland has turned into a silent, deserted city overnight. Oh, and as for the name of this underwater kingdom--Lemuria.
* ((This closely parallels the [[Lemurian disaster]] as described in [[Forgotten Sea]]. The emotional beats are right, even if the specific events aren't exactly the same. The myth doesn't reveal what happened to [[Forgotten Sea MC]], so this story is a chance for the writers to give us thematic clues.))

[[Louis]] then refers to the discovery of [[Lemurian]] ruins in 2034, hinting in a roundabout way that he knows/suspects that [[Lemurian]]s are real and that [[Rafayel]] is behind [[Mr. Fallon]]'s murder. But Rafayel's "aloof facade seems impenetrable." Louis tries one last time, saying he hasn't figured something out:

> When the Siren returns to the beach... How does he exact his revenge on those responsible for [[Lemuria]]'s destruction?

Louis then offers a thick personnel file. This Rafayel actually takes interest in, then he responds:
> "I think he'd first learn from them. [...] He's gotta study their wits and cruelty, you know."

Louis can't find a mistake in Rafayel's behavior, so he's left empty-handed again.

# 05 One-Man Show
> The young boy sits alone in the middle of the coral reef, softly humming "Siren's Ballad".
> Waves lap the shore, staining it dark red. The color blends almost seamlessly with the setting sun in the distance.
> Those who deceived him have long since sailed away on their massive ships, laughing all the while.
> "Siren's Ballad" isn't a song of revenge. It's an elegy sung for [[Lemuria]].

In a bathtub, Rafayel is plagued by memories.
> He feels like he's still underwater. The dying cries of his people echo in his ears, fizzing and crackling like a broken record that's being ground into pieces.
> Something in his chest howls, urging him to open his eyes and avenge them.
> Rafayel wants to stand up.
> Yet at the same time, his body is ensnared by the dark undertow. In darkness, the shadows of those he personally laid to rest emerge and drag him down, lower and lower into the depths.

> "Don't be scared."
> Amidst the chaos, Rafayel hears his mother's voice.
> He remembers last Saturday.
> He pushed [[K]]'s wheelchair out of the hospital room, all the way to the beach. "Hang in there. I'll bring everyone home."
> But K shook his head, looking at the sea. "I can't stand it anymore. They took away my scales and drew my blood. Over and over again. I'm no longer [[Lemurian]]."
* ((The immortality of [[Lemurian]]s is tied to their blood thematically. (See [[Forgotten Sea]] and [[Sea of Golden Sand]].) The "they" in this case isn't specified, but may be [[Ever]], due to their general obsession with immortality (see [[Xander Sciences]], [[Carter]]), unethical experiments, and involvement with [[Lemuria]] (see [[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures]]). To be "no longer Lemurian" means that K is no longer immortal.))

K's doctor reports that he's been in agony, and isn't sure how he's hung on so long. ((What remains of his Lemurian immortality is keeping him alive, but only to suffer. By asking [[Rafayel]] to perform the [[Seamoon Ceremony]], he's asking to be laid to rest. Given that [[Raymond's Lemurian skeleton]] is likely [[K]]'s daughter, it's probably that she has already died. If she were still alive, he'd have more of a reason to keep fighting.))

> The boundless land and sky had once been the dream of many [[Lemurian]]s, yet they couldn't have imagined it turning into a neverending nightmare.

Many of the other [[Lemurian]] survivors join for the [[Seamoon Ceremony]].

> ...Rafayel still found it hard to let go.
> When the moon reached its highest point in the sky, they pushed [[K]]'s body into the depths of the sea, watching him slowly become one with the water.
> In the crowd, K looked at Rafayel and smiled.
> Rafayel read his lips.
> "Don't be scared," he had said.
* ((The phrasing "became one with the water" may mean that [[K]] dissolved into seafoam. This is referenced often in-game with regards to [[Lemurian]]s, but [[Rafayel]] is cagey about whether it's true or not.))

Rafayel remembers his mother saying those words to him during a different [[Seamoon Ceremony]] when he was a child. Eventually, he's able to get out of the bathtub and return to the documents [[Talia]] gave him.

# 06 Next Performance
[[Louis]] reaches a pier, but [[Rafayel]] has already boarded a ship set to depart from [[Verona]]. The port's radio plays comments on the performance from the first chapter, giving us a tidbit of a rabid fan ((presumably charmed by Rafayel's siren song)).

The ship sails "many days" to [[Linkon]] City. Rafayel burns the documents in his possession, then muses, "Who knew the private detective's leads were, in some aspects, more comprehensive than his own?"
* ((It's unclear to me what was in the Personnel file that [[Louis]] gave him vs. what was in [[Talia]]'s documents. I don't think it's particularly consequential, either way.))

A seagull has traveled with him all the way, and he tells it that he's getting off the ship, and the seagull reluctantly leaves. As [[Rafayel]] disembarks, a picture of [[MC]] as a girl blows out of his pocket--but another seagull catches it and returns it to him. [[Rafayel]] promises the seagull snacks.
