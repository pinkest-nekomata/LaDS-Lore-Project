A recurring theme across myths and the main story.

"Heart arrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions, heart murmurs... Despite being aware of the risks, you still became a hunter." -- [[Zayne]], [[01-01.08 Doctor]]
* heart arrhythmia is simply a fast or slow heart rate, so this relates to him teasing her about her heart being fast when he's examining her.
* premature ventricular contractions can also describe a fluttering sensation, or "heart skipping a beat"
* heart murmurs are extra sounds that can be harmless or indicate a serious problem, depending. they come from turbulent blood flow.
* ((This could also be interpreted as Zayne teasing her, as these heart conditions can relate to romance tropes.))

"You had a transapical Metaflux ablation last month, right?" -- [[Greyson]], [[01-04.04 A Real Nightmare]]

"I'm thinking about what an Aether Core is, and why it was fused with my heart." -- [[MC]], [[01-05.03 Beyond Expectations]]

"The [[Protocore]] energy in your heart has always been stable. It can form an invisible shield to protect your heart when you're attacked. You also haven't become as weak as other patients with [[Protocore Syndrome]]. In other words, it's a power made just for you." -- [[Zayne]], [[01-05.03 Beyond Expectations]]
