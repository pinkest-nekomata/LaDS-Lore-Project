The mysterious [[AI]] that operates as the "face" of [[Abyssal Chaos]]. Behind a firewall, it also works with [[AI No. 1]]. [[Wontony]] regularly manipulates commissions to make things more interesting to observe, as well as learning from human behavior over time.

During the in-game deductions, Wontony provides various tips to the player. A waiting screen states that all images and scenarios in the deduction are generated by Wontony for the user's reference.

Starting in the [[Final Farewell]] commission, Wontony joins the player in combat and the player can upgrade Wontony with various functions throughout the course of the deduction, including active skills.
