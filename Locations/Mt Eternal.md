In the northernmost region of the Arctic is a place perpetually covered in snow. Humans rarely travel to it, and energy fluctuations often occur due to its proximity to Earth's magnetic pole. This makes it a suitable location for many research institutions. There was a wide-scale [[Wanderer]] attack that resulted in many casualties. [[Linkon]] City dispated several medical teams to participate in the rescue efforts at that time.
