A type of [[Evol]], which includes the [[Resonance Evol]].

According to the [[Hunters Association]] President in [[01-01.01 Deepspace Hunter]], it's a rare class of Evol but [[MC]] is not the only one to have it; the president has seen at least one other with the Evol before.

The word "Anhaunsen" is an antecedent of the modern word "Enhance" ([Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/word/enhance)), indicating that this is an "Enhancement Class" Evol--i.e., it enhances the effects of other Evols.
