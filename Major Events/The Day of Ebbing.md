A [[Lemurian]] phenomenon. There's a painting of the same name by [[Rafayel]]'s in [[Flux Arts]].

"Every year, there's a day where the tides go against the ocean currents. And using the night's countercurrent, creatures from the deep sea are washed ashore. Once the tides recede at dawn, they return home. As a result, everything they met that night turns into distant memories of the surface world. Some deep sea creatures are obsessed with the world outside the ocean, desiring its warmth. They stubbornly wait for the sunrise before returning. All just for a sun they've never, ever seen before..." -- [[Rafayel]]'s AI, [[01-02.06 Next Target]]
