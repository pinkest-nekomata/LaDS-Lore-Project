For reasons unknown, the Protocore that resides within my heart is a secret known to only a select few.
Aether Cores, their power surpassing that of a regular [[Protocore]], attracts anyone aware of their existence. Maybe it has something to do with [[Grandma]]'s past and what happened to my family...

# Other Info

## MC starts with half of an Aether Core
In [[02-01.08 Hesitation]], it's specifically confirmed by [[Philip]] that [[MC]] has half an Aether Core in/around her heart, and the other half is the one that will be available at the [[Protocore auction]] hosted by [[Sherman]]'s branch of [[Onychinus]]. [[MC]] first states this in [[02-01.04 Into Danger]], though it's not clear exactly how she learned this. She perhaps reached the conclusion based on the similarity of the [[Protocurve]] of the [[Aether Core]] to the data from her own [[Aether Core]] in [[Josephine's notes]].

Given that [[Josephine's secret notes]] mention [[MC]]'s energy readings dropped to half their previous value after the time she spent alone during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], this is likely when the other half of the Aether Core's power was separated from MC. It then existed independently from that point until MC reabsorbs it in [[02-02 Breakthrough]]. When [[Philip]] says her power is suppressed in [[02-01.06 Resonance and Shackles]], this may be due to the Aether Core missing its other half.
