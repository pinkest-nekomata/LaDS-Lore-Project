![[Wanderers_Spacepedia_image.webp]]
# Spacepedia
These monsters are made from [[Metaflux]]. They first appeared from the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] in various forms. While most species lack intelligence, they are formidable. They attach humans and animals and are not easy to defeat.

# Other Info

## Origin
Many Wanderers derive from natural phenomena mixed with [[Metaflux]], such as lava flows, tectonic activity, abnormal thunderstorms, eerie atmospheres, and more.

Especially given the existence of [[Intelligentia Type]] Wanderers that don't attack humans, they seem to have a "spirit" or "yokai" (CN: Yaoguai) flavor to them. They are often malevolent or predatory, but not outright evil. Normally, they lurk at the edges of society, whipped up by strong weather events or human transgressions (such as polluted waters). But when they encroach into populated areas, they're very dangerous.

## Threat Rank
C-B are approachable for rookies
A are dangerous
S and higher are very dangerous

## Detection
* The [[Hunter's Watch]] can pick up on the [[Metaflux]] fluctuations that Wanderers cause and are attracted to. MC's [[Resonance Evol]] is even more sensitive at picking these traces up.
* Wanderers can cause lights to flicker, and cause MC to experience invisible pressure. ([[01-02.03 Powder Keg]])

## Types
(Not exhaustive)
* [[Intelligentia Type]]

## Subspecies
