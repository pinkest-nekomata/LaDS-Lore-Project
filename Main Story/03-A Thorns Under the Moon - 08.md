# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Zayne]] attempt to locate the edge of the [[Protofield]], but their path is blocked by a black [[Protocore Cluster]]. Using her [[Resonance Evol]], MC is able to determine that the other cluster is on the opposite side of the Protofield. Zayne initially wants to be the one to take the longer journey, but [[MC]] convinces him to stay by reminding him that since this is his dream, he's more vulnerable here.

[[MC]] sets out, and [[Zayne]] is left to fight the [[Wanderer]]s that emerge from the [[Protocore Cluster]]. But the [[Protofield]] also seems to give rise to elements from his nightmare--ghosts of [[William]], [[Georgie]], and Georgie's mother first ask him why he didn't save them, then beg him to kill them.

[[Zayne]] sinks deeper into cold despair, his ice starting with a stalwart layer of white ice around the outside, but then becoming the black ice usually wielded by Dawnbreaker as he cuts the illusions down. Finally, the [[Protocore Cluster]] is destroyed--[[MC]] successfully reached the other one.

But then ice rises to encase him, and he hears a cold male voice that tells him not to risk himself for [[MC]] and "Seek your destiny. Only then can you be redeemed".

## Commentary

### Past 'victims'
[[William]] is [[Zayne]]'s former colleague, and the first person [[Zayne]] saw undergo [[human to Wanderer transformation]]. He became an [[Abomination]] (the word [[Still In Dark]] uses to refer to people as they begin to transform) and Zayne was forced to kill him.

The young boy, [[Georgie]] and the woman, Georgie's mother, are from the [[Still In Dark]] anecdote. Dawnbreaker agreed to kill Georgie's mother when she anticipated that she'd transform soon. Georgie then tagged along with him, but then began to transform. Zayne let him live just long enough to celebrate his twelfth birthday.

Crucially, this scene confirms that Dr. Zayne's nightmares have included the events of [[Still In Dark]], and Zayne is aware of them.

### White/Black ice
As also described in [[Zayne#Light and Dark]], the game consistently uses themes of white to represent [[Zayne - Linkon Doctor]] (white lab coat, white ice) and black to represent [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] (Black attire, black ice).

In the Protofield, Dr. Zayne remains himself but is dressed like Dawnbreaker. This scene continues the theme of blurred lines between them. Initially, Zayne notices black "impurities" in his ice:
> Dark impurities silently emerge from within them, but they stop spreading just as they're about to breach the outermost layer of the white crystals.
> It's as if a looming black hole threatens to consume everything pure and white. Yet a thin, unwavering layer of pristine ice remains resolute in being the last line of defense.

However, as the nightmare unfolds, Dr. Zayne is forced to start attacking the apparitions of his past "victims". At this point, the ice he wields becomes entirely black. Where the white ice represents Zayne's desire to save people as a doctor, the black ice represents Dawnbreaker's willingness to do what needs to be done, acting as the [[Grim Reaper]] when the time is right.

However, the idea of one day having to kill [[MC]] haunts him, as we see here.

### Voice of destiny
A cold voice that Zayne doesn't recognize speaks at the end of this scene as ice is encasing him.
> ?? (Male voice): You shouldn't throw yourself into danger just for her.
> ?? (Male voice): Seek your destiny. Only then can you be redeemed.

There are key parallels between this scene and the relationship between [[Zayne - Foreseer]] and [[Astra]] in [[Tower of Secrets]]. Astra's thorns trap and encase Zayne to punish him for seeing into his own fate (in order to help [[MC]], whose fate is bound to his). The notes about destiny and redemption hint at Astra. 

Notably, [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]] (Rafayel's branch) and [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] (Xavier's branch) reference those LI's respective myths. [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] is the focus here and is from an anecdote ([[Still In Dark]]) not a myth, so it's reasonable to expect at least some reference to Zayne's myth here.

# Details
MC notes that the surroundings feel very real, unlike a regular dream. She guesses that the level of detail is because of low long the recurring dream has been haunting him. ((This is symbolically true, but we also know from [[Still In Dark]] that the dreams reflect a real place.))

Zayne notes that despite the realism, the area has boundaries (of white fog), confirming it's a [[Protofield]]. In an alley that would otherwise be an exit, there's a cluster of [[black crystals]] that "blooms like a flower and is as tall as a three-story building", blocking the path.

MC guesses it's a [[Protocore Cluster]], and [[Zayne]] confirms he tried to destroy it before and it regenerates quickly. MC deduces that there must be a second cluster, and as long as one is intact it will provide energy to the other--only by destroying both at the same time can they escape.

MC is able to sense the other core's fluctuations with her Evol and determines it's on the other side of the Protofield. MC asks which one [[Zayne]] wants to take, and as he looks out over the [[Protofield]] with a mysterious emotion in his expression, he picks the one farthest away.
> *The far end of the city is cloaked in black mist, resembling the gaping maw of a beast hidden in the shadows.*

MC decides she wants the far one, since she's unwilling to let Zayne continue to face these dreams alone. But Zayne insists he'll get there faster since he knows the area. MC makes a good point that she's less vulnerable here, since it's not her dream.
> MC: Don't push yourself when you're in trouble. I got your back. That's a tip from your hunter escort.

She smiles, pats his back, and heads out.
> Zayne: Don't push yourself. That's a tip from your primary care physician.

It's a bittersweet moment as MC heads out, knowing they'll always support each other. After she leaves, it switches to Zayne's POV.

> As the girl walks away, her figure disappearing from the fork in the road, Zayne turns his gaze toward the alley's depths. Within the thick fog, a broken streetlight flickers intermittently.
> He raises his hand. Parts of the mist detatch themselves from the air. Spiraling and condensing, they coalesce into icicles above his palm.
> Dark impurities silently emerge from within them, but they stop spreading just as they're about to breach the outermost layer of the white crystals.
> It's as if a looming black hole threatens to consume everything pure and white. Yet a thin, unwavering layer of pristine ice remains resolute in being the last line of defense.
* ((This is a reference to the black ice that [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] uses to kill [[Abomination]]s, but in Zayne's hands it doesn't turn fully black. See also [[Zayne#Light and Dark]], [[black crystals#Dual meaning]]))

> Shadows stretch. And in the boundless fog ahead, the [[Protocore Cluster]] awaits his arrival like a slumbering [[Wanderer]].
> Within the mist, a cold wind materializes as aggressive figures sluggishly stir.
> `Wanderer growls are heard, and Zayne gasps softly.`
> The ice crystals in his palm slice the air and seemingly hit nothing. But the [[Protocore Cluster]] shimmers for a fleeting moment.
> As more [[Wanderer]]s emerge, their roars resound, and their figures phase in and out. The ice crystals solidify into sharp blades. Zayne delivers his attacks with decisive precision.
> Blades of ice tear through the darkness, and a pungent scent permeates the air. The ground beneath his feet slowly transforms. It turns soft and slimy like sludge, stubbornly clinging to his legs.
> Dazed, [[Zayne]] looks down. Peering through the mist and layers of unclear ice, his gaze falls onto his palm.

> ?? ([[William]]): Zayne...
> *A bloody hue taints his hand, and an eerie shadow is cast over his senses. He's momentarily transported back to that bone-chilling nightmare. Zayne is shocked. He looks up and knows who's standing before him. The tension is palpable, gripping him.*
> Zayne: ...[[William]]?
> William: It's too late... P-please...!
> *In the howling icy wind, Zayne hears his heavy breaths. Once again, he's returned to the endless, snow-covered expanse of [[Mt Eternal]].
> Bloody tears stream down from William's empty eye sockets. Then, an array of faces emerges from the cluster's projection.*
> ?? ([[Georgie]]): Aren't you... going to celebrate my birthday with me? Why... Did you kill me...
> ?? (Georgie's Mother): Aren't you a doctor?! You should've saved me! Why didn't you save me and my child...!
> William: Zayne, please... Kill me...!
> *He's suffocating. He's trapped. His head is spinning. Zayne notices his fingers are trembling uncontrollably. He staggers back only to trip over something again.*
> Zayne: It's... just an illusion. It's not real. It's not...
> *More and more hands stretch out toward him. They're frozen. The space around him shatters and distorts into mirrors--
> They reflect his bloodshot eyes. They reflect his hands clenched so tightly that veins bulge.
> A black icicle suddenly pierces through the mirrors and shatters part of the [[Protocore Cluster]]. The [[Protocore Cluster]] doesn't regenerate. It resembles a cliff teetering on the edge, ready to collapse in on itself.*
> Zayne: ... She made it.
> *As the mirror shards dissolve into black mist, the cold light intensifies and casts an ethereal glow. Determined, Zayne thrusts the ice blade toward the human figure.*
> Girl: Zayne...!
> *The ice blade stops as Zayne's pupils contract. It's her. But she can't possibly be here.*
> Girl: They're your patients... how could you... Am... I... Next... You'll... kill me... right? No... You're not Zayne. Who are you?!
> *It's a face he knows so well in this unspeakable nightmare. Her expression is filled with disbelief and pain. Yes, it's her.*
> Girl: Zayne... Kill me...!
> *Black ice flowers bloom from her cheset, their petals unfurling. She's as light as a piece of paper, separated from life's weight. yet she falls almost with a thud in his stiff embrace.
* ((Compare to the black crystals on the heart found in [[Zayne's research]] and the death of [[Cabin 607's patient]] due to [[X-Heart]]))

> Buzzing energy engulfs Zayne's ears as he's once again pulled into the depths of a never-ending nightmare. While he knows it's an illusion, he can't break free.
> At that moment, the cracked [[Protocore Cluster]] pulsates with a blood-red light. The air trembles around it.*
> Zayne: ...!
> *The massive shadow before him breaks along with the other [[Protocore Cluster]]. The illusion in his arms changes again, but he doesn't look up. He only clenches his fist.*
> Zayne: It's time to end this.
> *A cold gleam flickers, and pure black ice crystals surge beneath him. They freeze every figure that lurks within the shadows. The darkness is supressed, and his surroundings change. It's foggy. A blurry figure gradually emerges from the cracks in this space.
> Zayne conjures black ice and takes aim. However, his body becomes immobile as if he's frozen in place.*
> ?? (Male voice): `(Echoey)` You shouldn't throw yourself into danger just for her.
> Zayne: Who--Ugh!
> `A sound of blood squelching is heard.`
> *His entire body becomes encased in ice. [[Black crystals]] pierce his chest and spread to his fingers. The intense pain leaves Zayne's back drenched in sweat. He's unable to control his body as he collapses. His heart races in fear as he hears that cold voice.*
> ?? (Male voice): Seek your destiny. Only then can you be redeemed.
