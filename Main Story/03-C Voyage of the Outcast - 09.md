# Summary
[[Xavier]] wakes up, but they're not out of the woods yet. [[MC]] has determined that the [[Protofield]] has no edge. Xavier warns her that [[Soren]] could cause more to happen at any time, but he knows there may be something here that can help.

As they head through the forest, they talk about [[Soren]], and [[Xavier]] reveals only a little more to MC. He might be behind the [[traps for Xavier]]. He changed his appearance, which is why [[Xavier]] didn't initially recognize him. Xavier expresses concern that MC used the power of the [[Aether Core]]. When she tries to probe about his actions, he says "we're here".

## Commentary
Though Xavier says [[Soren]] is only "maybe" behind the [[traps for Xavier]], from a meta perspective we can take this as confirmation, especially since [[Xavier]] is cagey about these things.
# Details
Xavier comes to and is injured, but he recognizes MC. She tries to help him with his wounds, but he pulls away, giving her a thorough examination.
> MC: I'm fine. Don't tell me you're underestimating the power of an [[Aether Core]].
> Xavier: I underestimated *you*. An [[Aether Core]]'s power isn't something anyone should mess with. If you use it carelessly... The [[Protofield]] would have devoured you. What then?

MC is (mostly) sure she can control the power. She also couldn't stand by and do nothing. She knows it was a little reckless, but she doesn't want him to be mad.
> Xavier: `(sighs)` You always have so many reasons, but you never listen to me.
> MC: I will next time.

She teases him until he smiles. He takes the bandage and wraps his arm, then stands. The [[fluctuation]]s could return at any time, especially since [[Soren]] is still adding power to the [[Protofield]].

MC reveals that while Xavier was unconscious, she scouted the [[Protofield]] with her [[Evol]] and it doesn't seem to have any boundary. Xavier tells her not to worry, leading her deeper into the forest. He reveals that the [[Protofield]] is based on [[Xavier]]'s memories, so he has an idea of where to go.

MC's never heard of a [[Wanderer]] that can use memories to create a [[Protofield]], and [[Xavier]] confirms that [[Soren]] may have modified it.

> MC: Soren... He used to be your ally, right?
> Xavier: It was a long, long time ago. \[...] He changed his appearance and hid his Evol. He needs to hide his secrets and also be in a position to strike me down if needed.

MC guesses that [[Soren]] could be behind the [[traps for Xavier]], and he says "maybe".

> MC: Did something happen in this forest? Is that why you're... afraid of it? \[...]
> Xavier: Rather than what's already happened, I'm more afraid of what might come in the future. But right now, you terrify me the most. You used the power of the [[Aether Core]] this time. I'm worried about what you'll do next.
* ((This reference to "what might come in the future" is likely a reference to how [[Philos]] (and its core that devours her energy) is in the future from their current perspective.))

MC takes the chance to press him about his past. He dodges the question by saying "We're here."
