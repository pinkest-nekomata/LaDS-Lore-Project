The main POV character of [[WU-12 Fractal Library Q&A]].

The Administrator of the [[Fractal Library]] is very clear to point out that they are just the Administrator, not the curator or owner.

Over the years, they've done all sorts of jobs:
> mason, gardener, delivery driver, janitor, clerk, and more

This can be a person who's changed jobs many times, but it can also represent the concept of many lifetimes, see also [[branching timelines]].
