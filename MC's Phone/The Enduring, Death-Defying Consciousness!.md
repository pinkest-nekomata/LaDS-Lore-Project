>**The Enduring, Death-Defying Consciousness! Proving Souls Exist**

# Key Info
> Several scholars propose that since brain waves have been proven to generate energy, our cognitive activity, such as awareness, memories, and thoughts, could potentially be stored in the universe as energy [[fluctuation]]s. Even after the physical body dies, this "[[consciousness energy]]" persists, though it may also decay, transform, become forgotten, or overlap with new ideas. This might be why we can't remember past lives.

> These discussions seem to provide answers to phenomena such as memories of past lives, déjà vu, or love at first sight. Maybe past lives do exist, and those unexplainable feelings of familiarity might be the faint energy traces left by our past selves.
