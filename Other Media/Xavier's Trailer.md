Title: Love and Deepspace | Xavier ([YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCyCJrWN8Q8))

The launch trailers contain some specific information not otherwise in the game. This was posted Nov 2, 2023. Since it's at-launch content, it should theoretically align with the start of the main story content.

# Content
Voiceover:
> Xavier: This is my 214th spring on Earth. And it will be my last.
> Female narrator: Our planet has welcomed the 4,389.2 billionth sunrise. The Tracker Team has returned from Earth. The [[Deepspace Tunnel]] will be closed and we shall return to the era before immortality

Xavier selects a CD and it starts playing one of the game's main themes.

> Xavier: If there's still time before next spring, let's meet now.

# Commentary
On a meta level, this trailer hints at [[Xavier]]'s immortality, non-Earth origin, and extended time on Earth right from the bat.

The "Tracker Team" is almost certainly the [[Backtrackers]]. In [[Passing By#04 Old Friend]], it's mentioned that the [[Traceback II]] used the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] to get to Earth, so it makes sense that once the [[Backtrackers]] "return to the future" they'd close the tunnel.

The game also likes to leverage branching and [[converging timelines]], so Xavier's words can be interpreted as "a possible future", not the only or guaranteed future. The trailer plus lore seems to imply that Xavier's planning to return to [[Philos]]--perhaps because the [[Traceback II]] was fixed, or perhaps because he's out of the [[philosian drug]] that prevents him from aging.

For future-Philos, a "return to the era before immortality" is significant because it means they'll no longer be sustaining the energy of the planet's artificial core (see also [[Shooting Stars]]), freeing MC from her death loop. That being said, it's not clear if the planet itself can stay together without the core operational.

A YouTube comment mentions that Xavier's birthday card includes him committing to stay on Earth with MC--I'll need to check that for context. #todo
