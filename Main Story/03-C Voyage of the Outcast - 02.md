# Details
The suspicious [[Wanderer]] attacks five students at [[Prestara University]].

Three days later, [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] arrive for their commission:
> Task Details: lately, several students at [[Prestara University]] have disappeared after being attacked by the same [[Wanderer]], only to mysteriously reappear on campus a few days later. Although these students returned unscathed, they have no memory of what happened while they were missing.
> Objective: Find out the reasons behind these disappearances and eliminate the [[Wanderer]] on campus.

They're undercover as students, and will be pretending to be a campus TV group to interview the attacked students. ((Xavier wears his [[Xavier - Distant Youth]] outfit.)) The season is specifically noted as autumn.

As they discuss their plan, Xavier expresses that this lead seems unusually straightforward for being about an [[Aether Core]], and MC confirms that he means it feels like it could be a set-up.

Though the mission is urgent, they decide to relive their student days a bit, interacting with a film club to get in the right headspace.

The student council Vice President ((later revealed to be [[Soren]])) arrives, bashfully asking if they're the hunters he was told about, then telling them that the students are waiting to be interviewed. ((Later, it will be revealed that he's behind the [[Wanderer]] attack.))
