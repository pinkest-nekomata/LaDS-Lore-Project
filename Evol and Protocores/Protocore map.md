A mysterious and valuable item that was the apparent trigger for the [[N109 Zone]]'s [[2036 Disaster]]. Last known to be in [[Sylus]]'s possession in 2036.

Even Special Task Force cops like [[Ginevra]] were after it. In the end, [[Ginevra]] ended up working with [[Phantom Thief Pea]] to get it into [[Sylus]]'s hands in exchange for protection of [[Elysium]] and [[Aislinn]] during the [[2036 Disaster]]. ([[WU-14 Elysium]])

Shortly before the disaster, there were rumors of a "priceless [[Protocore]]" hidden somewhere in the N109 Zone, which made the map especially valuable. This is likely a reference to the [[Aether Core]]--specifically, the other half of [[MC]]'s [[Aether Core]] which she regains in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]].

As mentioned in [[Aether Core#MC starts with half of an Aether Core]], [[Josephine's secret notes]] seem to imply that MC lost half of the [[Aether Core]] during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. It would then be unsurprising for it to end up in the N109 Zone, since it was ground zero for the catastrophe.

What happened to the map and core after that are unclear, except that it eventually reappears in [[Sherman]]'s possession (and his branch of [[Onychinus]]) in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]].
