Relevant LI: [[Zayne]]
Main POV character: [[Georgie]], [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]]
Associated Companion: [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]]

In another timeline, a weary [[Grim Reaper]] dreams of being a doctor as he lays Abominations to rest.
## Summary
This is the life of the [[Grim Reaper]] of [[Zayne's Dawnbreaker dreams]]. It follows the experience of an eleven year old boy [[Georgie]]. Zayne saves him from a Wanderer attack, only to be forced to soon kill his mother too. [[Protocore]] exposure at a factory is causing [[human to Wanderer transformation]], but Georgie knows none of this.

He escapes an orphanage to follow [[Zayne]], hoping he can figure out who killed his mother. The stoic Dawnbreaker lets him tag along, slowly revealing that he dreams of being a doctor in a place called [[Linkon]] City that Georgie has never heard of. Zayne tries to lose himself in those dreams when he can, carrying around an old Linkon City Travel Guide and tending to a [[jasmine]] plant.

Meanwhile, [[Detective Ivan]] investigates the "Serial Killer" Dawnbreaker, not yet realizing that all his "victims" had already begun to turn into monsters.

Before long, [[Georgie]] starts his own transformation into a [[Wanderer]]. But when he asks [[Zayne]] to celebrate his 12th birthday with him, Zayne holds off. The next day, he takes Georgie to a dessert place and gets him a cake. Ivan arrives to "save" Geogie--only for him to start to transform. Zayne kills him.

Later, Zayne and Ivan visit the graves of Georgie and his mother, revealing that the "higher ups" are going to great lengths to keep the [[human to Wanderer transformation]] secret, and [[Zayne]] is the only one preventing the [[Wanderer]] problem from getting more out-of-hand.

## Commentary
This anecdote elaborates on Zayne's themes of death and duality: See especially [[Zayne's death theme]] and [[Zayne#Light and Dark]].

Since there's a lot to unpack with the [[spacetime]] here, discussion of this timeline is centralized in [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]].

Chapter 04, Nightmare explicitly ties Zayne's character to a key story in Chinese philosophy, Zhuangzi's butterfly dream. In it, a man dreams he's a butterfly, then wakes and is unsure if he's the butterfly's dream. This dream/reality uncertainty/duality is key to [[Zayne]]'s character.

# 01 Visitor
An eleven year old child, [[Georgie]] and his mother attempt to flee from a Wanderer that's the result of [[human to Wanderer transformation]]:
> It wore human clothing and bore a human-like visage, but its veiny skin grotesquely bulged. Its pupils glowed a sinister, unnatural blue; its aura was anything but human.

Georgie's mother throws herself at the Wanderer to protect her son. [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] appears and kills the Wanderer--Georgie thinks he's the [[Grim Reaper]]. The [[Wanderer]] dissolves into mist and dark blue fragments, saving Georgie and his mother.

(In Chapter 06, we learn that Georgie's mother approached Zayne shortly after this, suspecting that she would turn soon due to [[Protocore]] exposure at the factory she worked at. She asked him to kill her before she could transform. He keeps his promise, and in Chapter 02 we learn that Georgie went to an orphanage, then ran away to find Zayne.)

A month later, Georgie's been following Zayne, and finds him buying chocolate at a convenience store. ((Even in this dark timeline, Zayne loves sweets.)) He asks Zayne to help him find who killed his mother. Stoic, Zayne tells him to ask the police.

# 02 Mystery
[[Detective Ivan]] has been tasked with investigating the "serial killer" Dawnbreaker. The first time he sees Zayne, he also gets the aura of impending death (another indirect [[Grim Reaper]] reference). So far, the police think that the blue fragments are Zayne's doing--he doesn't realize that Zayne is intervening only after they start to transform. Ivan notes that the fragments resemble Wanderer Protocores, but since they don't know about [[human to Wanderer transformation]] he doesn't know what to make of it.

We then get some backstory:
> Long before Ivan's generation was born, Wanderers had appeared on Earth. As far back as he can remember, Wanderers roamed the city, prompting people to spend most of their time indoors to avoid them. Many simple tasks were delegated to robots, and people indulged in VR to pass their remaining years.
> Ivan was taught that Wanderers were amalgamations of energy. So why do the victims leave behind a substance resembling a [[Protocore]] after death?
* "amalgamations of energy" is another way of saying they're made of [[Metaflux]], which is consistent with the [[Wanderer]] information in the Spacepedia.
* ((Note: There's a detailed discussion of the [[spacetime]] of these events in [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]].))

With the help of an AI system, Ivan intercepts Zayne at his next kill. He observes the process of a human turning and Zayne cutting it down with his Ice Evol. Zayne vanishes, and Ivan struggles to find more clues. He does end up learning that [[Georgie]]'s mother worked at an underground [[Protocore]] factory and was laid off a few months ago.

# 03 Shelter
Georgie shows up at Zayne's apartment with an offering of chocolate. Zayne lets him into the apartment, though remains stoic.

Georgie soon observes a lot about Zayne's life:
* An old medical drama from "decades ago" plays on Zayne's holographic screen.
* Other than his sweet treats, Zayne lives off of chocolates
* Every day, Zayne tends a budding [[jasmine]]
* His closet is full of black clothes, "like a wardrobe dedicated to funerals"
* He has another screen in his bedroom with many green dots
	* (We later learn this tracks the population in the area. Green dots are safe. Red dots have begun to transform into Wanderers.)
* This Zayne buys sodas and freezes them in midair into an "[[Old Popcicle]]"
	* (We soon learn this is something he saw in Dr. Zayne's dreams.)
* Zayne is one of the few people who goes outside.
* Zayne frequents an "abandoned plaza with overgrown grass. [...] a patch of [[jasmine]] flowers blooms amidst the decaying city."
* Once there, Zayne reads a [[Linkon]] City Travel Guide, which is very old.
	* Georgie doesn't recognize the name "Linkon City."
	* Zayne has been marking key locations in this book. We soon learn he marks the locations from his dreams of Dr. Zayne.

The conversation about the Linkon City Travel Guide gives a few more timing clues:
> "Is this book very old? As old as my grandpa? No, it should be even older than that..."

# 04 Nightmare
Dawnbreaker Zayne reflects on his dreams of Dr. Zayne. He dreams of being with "a girl", and the many things they do together, like buying snacks and freezing soda into popcicles.

> He was 12 the first time he had such a dream, but the dreams didn't happen in a particular order. They were fragmented. So, when he was 12, he already knew the doctor in his dreams would meet that girl at 27.

Dawnbreaker wishes to be absorbed in the world of those pleasant dreams, and "the landmarks that can only be found in travel guides".
* ((This comment about landmarks could hint that this place is geographically different than [[Linkon]]--or, that the city has been rendered unrecognizable by time and disaser.))

Zayne returns to watching the medical drama, while Georgie naps. But the child wakes up frightened from a nightmare where he's a monster. Georgie's mother has told him "dreams are the opposite of reality", and he hopes this is true. Zayne tries to comfort him by changing the channel to an animated film.

The film briefly summarizes the real-world work of Chinese philosophy, Zhuangzi's butterfly dream. In this text, a man dreams he's a butterfly, and upon waking, he's not sure if he's a man dreaming of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming of being a man. Georgie is left feeling confused--is he a boy dreaming of being a monster, or a monster dreaming of being a boy?

From [TheChinaStory.org](https://www.thechinastory.org/yearbooks/yearbook-2019-china-dreams/forum-illusions-and-transformations-the-many-meanings-of-meng-夢/zhuangzi-and-his-butterfly-dream-the-etymology-of-meng-夢/):
> The constant flux between dreams and awakening leads the ‘self’ to change from being unaware of the distinction of things to being aware of the definite distinction between and among things. [...] Two contrasting interpretative traditions have evolved: one drawing on the image of the carefree butterfly that hinted at a bright and soaring future; the other gloomy and melancholy, leading to a reading of ‘life is but a dream’. [...] By reinterpreting the dream in a worldly frame of displacement in space and time, they moved away from Zhuangzi’s contemplation of the question of agency, initiative, and the ‘distinction’ 分 of things.
* Within this anecdote, we see clearly this idea of being displaced in space and time:
	* Georgie is dreaming of his own future, where he'll become a monster
	* Zayne is dreaming of a different version of himself, an alternate timeline and/or past life.

Georgie correctly guesses that Zayne dreams of being a doctor, and he wonders if the doctor dreams of him--and if Dawnbreaker is a nightmare to the doctor. (He is.)

During that conversation, [[Georgie]] shows signs of his [[Wanderer]] transformation beginning. Zayne readies to kill him, but when Georgie says that tomorrow is his 12th birthday and asks Zayne to celebrate it with him, Zayne hesitates. (The twelfth birthday is significant to him too, after all.)
* (([[Zayne#Light and Dark]] further explores the significance of the number 12, which itself can represent yinyang))
* ((If this is a correct interpretation, then it's especially poignant because over his 12th birthday Georgie is on the cusp of transforming into a monster, representing this brief moment of balance/tension between light and dark.))

Zayne lets Georgie live for the night, heading back to his bedroom to turn off the alarm just before it goes off--the screen now shows a red dot at Georgie's location.

# 05 Birthday
Zayne tends to the [[jasmine]] then takes [[Georgie]] to a dessert place. He gets macarons because he dreamed about Dr. Zayne eating them the night before.

Georgie gets a cake with twelve candles and wishes to figure out who killed his mom. They enjoy their cake together. Zayne reveals he stopped celebrating his birthday when he was 12.

Zayne remembers that on his birthday, his adoptive father became an Abomination (the precursor to a Wanderer) and attached his wife, Zayne's adoptive mother. Zayne watched his mother die, then used his Evol to defend himself from his own father, stabbing in the heart--his first kill.

Later that night, he dreamed of being a doctor and treating [[MC]].

Georgie marvels at his first sunset--he's only seen them in VR before. At that moment, [[Detective Ivan]] and the others arrive to "save" Georgie, finding the sweet birthday scene. That's when Georgie turns into an Abomination. Georgie injures Ivan, but Zayne kills him with a black ice shard through the heart before he can do more harm.
>Georgie lowers his head, seeing blackened ice bloom like a flower on his chest.

Georgie asked if the monster woke up--then dissolves into mist.

# 06 Cover-Up
Zayne visits two unmarked tombstones that belong to Georgie and his mother. He leaves a jar of chocolates for Georgie, remembering how his mother had approached her when she was laid off.

She knew some of her coworkers had turned into Wanderers and suspected it was because of [[Protocore]] exposure at the factory. (See also [[human to Wanderer transformation]].) She tried to blow the whistle, but was fired in order to preserve the secret.

Ivan approaches with flowers for the tombstone, revealing that he now understands what's going on and is committed to keep Zayne's secret. He tried to share the information about the [[human to Wanderer transformation]], but his reports were suppressed and his family received death threats to keep him quiet. Ivan also asks Zayne to kill him if he becomes an Abomination.

Zayne is dreaming again--and hears happy birthday. [[MC]] sings it to him--it's the doctor's birthday. He reaches out to touch her--and she suddenly realizes he's not Dr. Zayne.

An alarm from his Wanderer tracking system wakes him. He's confused at what just happened.
> It's as if she saw through time and space, through his dreams, to realize he's not the doctor.

In the moonlight, the [[jasmine]] has bloomed.
