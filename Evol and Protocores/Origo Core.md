An [[Aether Core]] "born from destruction".

"Origo" means "origin" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/origo)) and combined with the core being depicted as golden in [[cosmic cinematic#All From Deepspace]], we can conclude that this is the specific core MC was "born" with and she completed in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]].

So, the planet collapsing, becoming the Origo Core, and approaching Earth on the brink of collapse in [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]] is a representation of MC's own resurrection at that point in time. The phenomenon of her memories returning to her seems to be enabled by [[Sylus and MC's Evol linkage]] as noted in [[05-02.04 Dust of Memories]].

The quote "Everything and nothing has changed" hints at a Ship of Theseus type phenomenon: On the one hand, MC has been totally reborn and rebuilt. On the other hand, with all her familiar memories returning, she's the same as she's always been. See also: [[MC's Rebirth Deep Dive]]

Possibly also a reference to [[Decoherence]], where [[A-01 MC]] and [[Mecha Caleb]]'s "destruction" powers surge out of control and destroy the planet. However, it may be the other way around, that she has destruction powers in that timeline because destruction powers are her base state.
