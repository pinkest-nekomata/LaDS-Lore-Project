> Every Hunter knows about UNICORNS. They're the best combat unit under the [[Hunters Association]]. Known for their unmatched power and fast responses, they specialize in tackling extremely dangerous [[Wanderer]] incidents that regular Hunters can't handle. \[...] Their elite sector is small and notoriously unconventional. One rumor claims a UNICORNS hunter once blew up an entire subway station just to take down a [[Wanderer]].
