# Summary
As [[MC]] recovers, she insists on resonating with [[Zayne]] again. They briefly discuss his dreams, and his fear that he'll one day not wake up. MC assures him earnestly at first, then with a silly declaration that if all else fails, she'll bury him in a giant snowman. The resonance works, and all the black ice disappears.

They head back out into the hospital's courtyard, and briefly discuss their options. They decide to destroy the [[Protofield]], resonating and coating the entire place in ice. This forces the mutated [[Wanderer]] out of hiding.

## Commentary
With MC's help, Zayne is able to wield the black ice without negative consequences.

# Details

The last line from chapter 09 repeats:
> MC: Zayne, what did you do while I was unconscious? Is this why you're losing control of your Evol?
> Zayne: ...
> *His silence confirms my suspicions. I lower my head, and my hands that rest on his tighten. Before the worry and guilt in my heart coalesce into coherent words, they disappear because of Zayne's presence.
> He lowers his head, and his chin rests on the top of my head.*
> Zayne: `(quietly)` You're my hunter escort, correct? Protecting you is protecting myself. And... After subjecting you to a distressing dream, ensuring you can leave safely is the least I should do.

MC tells him he shouldn't act like he's caused her so much trouble--it's the [[Wanderer]]. But again, he mentions the [[Wanderer]] might not be the only source of danger. He suggests the dream itself might be the real threat.

> *I realize something. After we entered the [[Protofield]] that's based on Zayne's dream, he's been acting more hesitant. Could it be...*
> MC: Zayne, this nightmare is more than just a dream to you, right?
> *I sense his hand subtly move, a testament to its master's emotions that are always restrained.*
> Zayne: A dream remains a dream so long as you wake up from it. But when that day comes... When I can't wake up...
> MC: Are you worried you'll be trapped in your dreams? Or that your dreams will encroach on reality? If that day ever comes...

The player is given a dialogue option to say they'll wait for him or find him in their dreams. Then, she begins to resonate with him.
> *Zayne's breath hitches, as if it's suspended in the air for a while. Then he exhales, his breath carrying the weight of unspoken sentiments.*

Finally, MC 'solemnly' promises:
> MC: If all else fails, I'll bury you in the body of a snowman. You'll be a super big snowman.
> Zayne: ...What?
> *I close my eyes and banish the myriad of questions and worries from my mind.*
> MC: If you can't deal with it by yourself, then we'll face it together. I'm the best there is, so I'm sure I can lend a hand.
> Zayne: ...I see your problem solving skills are more on the straightforward, brutal side. Should we consider this a side effect of you becoming stronger?
> MC: It's called having the freedom that comes with power!

As MC resonates, all the black ice disappears. She asks if it still hurts--and he says it doesn't anymore. Just as she's about to tell him not to lie, he summons two ice seals in her hand. He tells her this is her reward for being a hunter escort. She tells him to take better care of himself.

On this lighter note, they head back out to the hospital garden. Zayne reflects that the mutated [[Wanderer]] could be hiding anywhere. After a brief conversation, they decide that they need to destroy the [[Protofield]]. They resonate.
> *Black snowflakes drift from our interlocked fingers. The night wind momentarily suspends before swirling into a frenzied flurry once more. Underneath our feet, a vast expanse of ice crystals blossoms...
> The ground, the buildings, and even the particles floating in the air were all ensnared int he swift spreading of the chilling night, wrapped in its icy embrace. In an instant, the entire world froze into a black amber.
> A rift violently tears through the fabric of this space. The Wanderer can't hide anymore. It screeches and reveals its true form.*
> MC: There it is. Let's go.
> *Zayne's coat flutters in the wind. Amidst nightmarish darkness, an icy glimmer materializes in his hand.*
> Zayne: Let's end this before the breaking dawn arrives...
