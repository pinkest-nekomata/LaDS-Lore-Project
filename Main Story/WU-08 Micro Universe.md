Expanding on [[Rafayel]]'s time teaching at [[Linkon University]], with a meeting of art and science

## Summary
A grad student and [[Ever]] intern [[Michael]] takes an art appreciation class with [[Rafayel]]. The key takeaways from a lore perspective are:
* Expands on [[Rafayel]]'s ties to [[Verona]] (which is where he was before returning to [[Linkon]], per [[Siren's Song]])
* [[Ever]] has been doing experiments on [[Lemurian]] cells ([[LCMEC]]s)

## Commentary
The depiction of art and art critique in this story is spot on, and I definitely recommend reading it. I've focused mostly on the details that are consequential to the lore here, which is why some sections are short.

Sussing out the timing of this story is a little interesting. [[A Unique Vermillion]] establishes [[Rafayel]] working at [[Linkon University]] for the first time, and his initial class series is on [[Lemuria]], with a 1 year teaching commitment. Given that this story describes a spring semester class, and [[A Unique Vermillion]] starts in late summer, it's likely that this story describes Rafayel's spring class period. It's also possible that [[Rafayel]] stayed on and taught for more than a year. Inferring from [[MC#Timeline]], this is likely 2045-2047. Fortunately, the exact timing here isn't too consequential.

Given that the [[Gaia Research Center]] is functional again, it must have been rebuilt.

# 01 Art Appreciation & Criticism
[[Michael]] has been a researcher at the [[Gaia Research Center]] for six months, and at the end of his shift he heads over to his university for classes.

He's close to graduating, and right now his Art Appreciation & Criticism class is a bright spot amidst the stress. [[Rafayel]] is teaching it as a guest professor. [[Michael]] thinks he's great, while some of the other students find him too critical, according to the reviews showing up in the school's system now that the year is nearly over. Michael thinks back to when he first started the class.

# 02 Lesson One
On his first day in class, [[Michael]] finds himself getting along surprisingly well with [[Rafayel]]. Though he can't put words to it, he finds the artist's work very compelling. Rafayel ends up inviting him to sit in the front, and Michael helps Rafayel stay on-task. Michael notices that Rafayel's abstract paintings remind him of what he used to grow in petri dishes.

# 03 True Colors
[[Rafayel]] shares one of his paintings with the class, and the other students give it flowerly praise. Only [[Michael]] is brave enough to go with his gut and say it's messy, though the colors are compelling. [[Rafayel]] confesses that the painting was just him venting his anger at his agent ([[Thomas]]), and [[Michael]] begins to see that art is no longer this complicated, unattainable world.

Meanwhile, he's been trapped in grey concrete buildings, staring at a single color that belongs to "[[LCMEC]]s".

# 04 Absurdity and Negative Space
A critique day inspires [[Michael]] with an idea for his final project. (Note that the "intended blank" referred to within the narrative should have been localized to "negative space" as in the title. "intended blank" is likely a literal translation. The gist comes across, though.)

# 05 Field Trip
They go on a trip to [[Verona]]. [[Michael]] expects [[Rafayel]] to be an art elite, but he shows a down-to-earth side, enjoying salted fish and cutting paper into silhouettes of the buildings.

[[Michael]] happens across [[Rafayel]] in a picturesque courtyard and "saves" him from a cat. [[Michael]] is touched that [[Rafayel]] remembers his name, since back at the lab he's just a number.

Back in the present time, it's [[Michael]]'s final class with [[Rafayel]], and he's sad to think there might not be more art in his life after this. He enjoys his classmates' presentations, and once they've left, he brings his own final project to [[Rafayel]]. It's an image of [[LCMEC]]s, which remind him of [[Rafayel]]'s paintings.

Rafayel is transfixed by the name of the cells, but [[Michael]] isn't yet sure why. ((The cells are Lemurian Cardiac Microvascular Endothelial Cells))

# 06 LCMECs
[[Michael]] has graduated and three months later is about to work at [[Ever]] HQ, a coveted position for his field. He chats with a colleague, asking where [[LCMEC]]s come from. They're cagey about it, reminding him that [[Ever]] keeps that under wraps. But [[Michael]] remembers the L word starts with "Lem" and forms a hunch. (Since he references a "long gone" civilization, we know he's talking about [[Lemuria]].)

[[Michael]] remembers what else happened when he showed [[Rafayel]] his art. [[Rafayel]] held it up to the window's light, and as the window vibrated:
> ... the microscopic universe on the paper seemingly came alive. Tiny colored blocks transformed into miniature colorful fish, their tails flickering as they danced from [[Rafayel]]'s fingertips into the dusty air.

[[Rafayel]] wants to know whether the source of the cell is living or dead subjects, but [[Michael]] isn't sure--it depends. Rafayel says not to worry about it, then asks what [[Michael]] thinks of the cells. Michael replies:
> "They're... a perfect blend of biology and art! They make me see life as an art form."

Michael elaborates that the cells "hold secrets about life itself", and seeing them in an artistic way has reinvigorated his passion for discovery and exploring the microscopic world.

[[Rafayel]] seems genuinly touched, agreeing that biology is "a masterpiece painted by nature itself."
