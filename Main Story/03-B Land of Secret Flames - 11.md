# Summary
As they reach the surface, the centuries-old antique boat from the shore ([[03-B Land of Secret Flames - 07]]) is waiting for them. Once inside, Rafayel comes to, but he seems out of it. He warns MC to stay back. Gradually, a force overcomes him, causing his scales to appear, his eyes to glow bright blue, and fin-like ears of light to glow around his.

He becomes menacing, speaking of sacrifices and saying he has no need for traitors. MC invokes the power of the [[ocean's covenant]], causing the [[glowing red fish symbol]] to appear on his chest. She resonates, and Rafayel snaps out of it, coming back to his senses. He reveals that this is part of the price to pay for reclaiming the forgotten power and awakening the [[Dead Deep Sea]] and the [[Sea God]]. He also reveals a [[Spatium Core]] fragment, saying it was embedded in the tome.

## Commentary

### Sea God's power
As the [[Sea God]]'s power reawakens, it possesses [[Rafayel]]. It's not immediately clear whether or not he recognizes [[MC]] when he calls her a traitor.

### Spatial Distortion
This branch is the only one that does not feature a [[Wanderer]] with space-distorting abilities. It's not outright stated, but it seems to be the [[Tome of the Sea God]] that's able to use these properties to appear at the [[blue hole]], calling to Rafayel, effectively turning into a portal, like [[Rafayel]] hints at in his earlier description.

### How did the core fragment get in the Tome?
[[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures]] hints at [[Ever]] having been active in [[Lemuria]]'s ruins. It's possible that they lost the core there, or conversely, were trying to retrieve it from there.

# Details
> We leave the [[blue hole]] via a narrow gap in the seabed. When we resurface, we find ourselves in the ocean. There's a small island in the distance. A nearby ship gently rocks with the waves. It looks as if it's been waiting for a long time. Boarding the ship's hold, I look at its old mast and sails. I know this is the ship that ran aground on the island.

Rafayel comes to. MC asks what happened. Sounding irritated, he asks for a minute, leaning his head against his elbow on the side of the ship.

MC asks if he's hurt, showing concern. She holds the back of her hand to his neck.
> Rafayel: `(calmly)` No.
> `Shimmering blue scales appear on his neck.`
> MC: Scales, you're...
> `MC touches the scales, and Rafayel nuzzles into her palm.`
* (([[MC]]'s reference point here would be the [[Ebb and Flow]] bond, where she first sees his scales and learns he's [[Lemurian]]. This is why she tries to check his temperature, since he overheated then.))
> Rafayel: This... couldn't be considered gentle...
> `He pulls away from her, touching his forehead again.`
> Rafayel: It's getting... `(sternly)` Stay back.
> `Blue light glows around them.`
> MC: (What's going on...)
> `He grabs her wrist. As he pulls his other hand down and opens his eyes, scales glow on his cheeks and his eyes glow blue. His expression is intense, threatening.`
> MC: Rafayel?
> `He pulls her wrist closer to him. She struggles. He pins her against the boat.`
> Rafayel ([[Sea God]]): A follower? Or just a lowly sacrifice?
* ((He's now being possessed by the [[Sea God]]. These are terms from [[Forgotten Sea]].))
 > MC: You don't recognize me anymore?!
 > `There's lightning above as a storm blows in. Glowing fin-like ears appear around Rafayel's. MC tries to move away but he pins her again. Whispers rise around them.`
 > Rafayel ([[Sea God]]): Death... When the storm surges from the deep sea...
 > MC: Rafayel, snap out of it!
 > Rafayel ([[Sea God]]): The [[Sea God]]... `(he grabs her chin)` awakens... I... have no need... for traitors!
 > MC: `(holding a hand against his chest)` With the authority granted to me by the [[ocean's covenant]], I order you to... `(The` [[glowing red fish symbol]] `appears under her hand. She resonates)`
 > `The glowing blue is gone, leaving Rafayel reeling.`
 > Rafayel: You...
 > `He collapses over her, sniffing her neck and nuzzling her collarbone as if for comfort.`
 > MC: Do you know who I am, Rafayel?
 > Rafayel: Of course.
 
 She sits up, and Rafayel tells her not to worry. He holds out an [[Aether Core]] fragment (specifically a [[Spatium Core]] fragment) from his palm.
 > Rafayel: I think it was embedded in the Tome. I was drawn to its power. It seems like we both received a gift from the [[Tome of the Sea God]]. But there's always a price to pay for something like that.
 > \[...]
 > MC: This price you have to pay--what is it? Do you need to be a sacrifice... or the [[Sea God]]?
 > Rafayel: ...The [[Dead Deep Sea]] and the [[Sea God]]'s power have been awakened. And since I accepted its power, I must answer its call. Even if certain futures have a predetermined end, I can't refuse...
* ((Contrast this to [[Rafayel]] attempting to change the prophecies in the Tome in [[Forgotten Sea]].))

Exhausted, Rafayel rests in her arms. She asks about his future, but he doesn't answer. The sea is quiet now.
