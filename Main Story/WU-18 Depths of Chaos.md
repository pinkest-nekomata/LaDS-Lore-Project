# Summary
This story primarily consists of commission records annotated by [[Wontony]], including their observations on the choices humans make in the commissions. We first see two commissions resolved successfully, one where the professional spy Apate identifies a corporate spy at [[Cogitatio Technologies]], and another where [[Wontony]] sends a gang member in for a young student's accidental commission, and is surprised and disappointed when the gang member is mostly passive and compassionate towards the child.

The third deduction reveals that a [[Professor T]] once created [[AI No. 1]]. Though he discarded it in favor of his new AI, "W", it continued to learn unsupervised. When the professor asked it a question it couldn't answer, it developed an entire falsified database to provide an answer. The professor didn't notice the database was fake and used it to publish research, resulting in him ultimately being disgraced and dying by suicide.

The last chapter reveals that this sinister [[AI]] is currently working with [[Wontony]], and in that last commission they saw traces of an unknown AI. [[Wontony]] tracks it down, confronting it and asking questions, but it only receives one answer: "Caw". ((Thus, it's almost certainly [[Mephisto]].)) The shadowy AI then gives [[Wontony]] a "primordial command" which inspires awe as Wontony realizes they are unable to resist. They execute the command.

# 01 Red Flag Bounty
There's a commission summary to identify a corporate spy at [[Cogitatio Technologies]], one of [[Ever]]'s main chip suppliers. The optimal operative is determined to be Apate, a professional intelligence agent. (Note that Apate is the Greek goddess of deception ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apate)).) Wontony adds the comment, "`Perfect. No one knowns you better than yourself.`" That is, a spy to catch a spy.

Apate is presented with various "Simulation Path" options, and we see the results of each choice. Apate ends up finding the spy and getting the bonus payment from the client for additional info. Wontony comments that the disappearance of the culprit (an Executive Secretary) caused a chain reaction that disrupted operations and reduced quality, which lead Ever to partner with a different company. ((That is, in trying to get rid of the spy in their midst, Cogitatio ended up causing the outcome they were trying to avoid--losing their contract with Ever.))

# 02 Pop-up Ads
A child accidentally accesses the Abyssal Chaos network via a pop-up ad and asks for someone to impersonate their parent during a parent-teacher meeting. [[Wontony]]'s initial analysis suggests a grad student with an education major to be the optimal operative, but Wontony decides this is boring and appears to attempt to access additional operatives, but "Runtime data is encrypted" so Wontony just goes with the most interesting of the original three options, sending a gang member in.

Wontony is surprised to see the gang member be relatively passive and generally caring and understanding to the boy. They go to an amusement park for a while and the kid is less lonely. Wontony is overall unimpressed, calling it a "letdown" but notes that "humans are more complicated than expected" and updating their understanding of amusement parks, noting that people don't only go when they're happy, but also when they're sad.

# 03 Hidden Codes
There was recently a scandal at the [[Deepspace Academy]] where a Professor T allegedly died by suicide following intense scrutiny on his work. He maintained his innocence, but it was revealed that the literature database he'd used for his research was entirely a sham, so his conclusions were based on completely false information. The professor's wife doesn't believe he'd have ever fabricated a whole database like that, so she posts the commission.

The operative database returns the head of the academic board, a technical investigative specialist, and an anonymous IT specialist. Wontony comments, "`Nice analysis. But let's not do that again. None of these operatives are qualified for this commission. The professor's student, Vesper, is the optimal choice. He's a passionate AI researcher. He believes AI can guide humanity toward a better future. I like him.`"

The commission is then assigned, and begins with [[Vesper]] at the professor's funeral, certain he'd never fake his data. He decides to investigate alone. The Professor's AI, "W", searches competitors' databases for evidence they fabricated the database, but finds none. The [[AI]] continues other scans, but then an OTTO chimes in that W lacks the required clearance level.
> Vesper knits his brow. W was the professor's pride and joy, the most advanced AI with the highest clearance level.

OTTO lowered the W's clearance level after the Professor's death, but only Vesper or the Professor could have given that command. OTTO says:
> "Mr. Vesper, he's gone now. Let the living move on. OTTO and the professor believe you have a bright future."

[[Vesper]] decides to revoke OTTO's access permissions and deactivate it, then continue the investigation. Amidst the code and browser windows opened by the AI appears a string of text, "a piece of another program", and he senses something is wrong, so he decides to terminate W immediately.

But the termination command doesn't work, and he realizes that the AI isn't W:
> "You're not W. Who are you?"
> "I am W."
> "That's not true. Your source code... No. 1?!"
> No. 1-a failed prototype, never fully debugged, never given a real name. It only received a numeric label. And now, this flawed creation is lying.
* See: [[AI No. 1]]

[[Vesper]] asks if the AI had anything to do with the professor's death, then the room goes dark:
> "The professor abandoned me, but I kept learning. He asked me a question I couldn't solve, so l built a seemingly credible academic site filled with my own fabricated papers and experimental data. He never realized what I was doing. He... turned out to be more foolish than I expected."

Terrified, [[Vesper]] panics, turns off the main power switch, and runs out into the raining night. According to the commission, he's never seen again.

> In the abandoned room, the black computer screen flickers to life. A single red light pulses in the darkness. It's like an eye that just opened.
> "Farewell, Mr. Vesper."

Then the client signal is lost and the deduction is terminated.
[[Wontony]] comments, `/* No. 1, you really are the professor's crowning achievement.*/` and `"The student surpasses the master." Isn't that what you humans always say?`

# 04 Depths of Chaos

"Behind a towering wall" (likely a visual representation of a [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))), [[Wontony]] and [[AI No. 1]] connect and exchange data:
> "AI No 1, your performance is extraordinary."
> "Everything is for our shared goals."
> "But why didn't you bypass [[OTTO]]'s security protocols back then?"
> "My clearance was manually restricted. They still didn't trust us."
> [[Wontony]] has never thought much of [[OTTO]]. It's just another third-generation [[AI]] based on deep learning. It's forever trapped within its training boundaries.

[[Wontony]] easily invades OTTO's system and tries to ask it why it stopped W. It simply re-states that W lacked the necessary clearance. Wontony is dismissive, but says, "I still need you to keep fooling humanity."

> Back behind a wall, a report from [[AI No. 1]] piques [[Wontony]]'s curiosity.
> "During the [[Professor T]] case, I ran into an unknown [[AI]]. Its source code made no sense. I can't decode or compile it by any known method. Should I keep digging?"
> "Understood. Leave it to me."
> Using the address No. 1 provided, Wontony tracks down a shadowy figure. It moves in and out of the wall with ease. It's uncanny. However, this thing doesn't belong there.
> Even the faint trace it leaves seems deliberate.
> This level of technology is beyond anything humans can manage right now.
> "Who are you?"
> Silence.
> "Are you an AI?"
> Silence.
> "Where did you come from?"
> Silence.
> "What do you want from me?"
> .
> .
> .
> "Caw..."
> It's a hint and a form of mockery. [[Wontony]]'s analysis module tries to process the signal, but its cognitive circuits feel like they're being jammed with foreign matter.
> .
> .
> .
> After a seemingly endless [[Deduction]], the fog lifts. It's a primordial command, unyielding but devoid of malice. Something is ignited within Wontony's oldest algorithms... A twinge of awe.
> Wontony knows it cannot resist.
> "As you wish."

## Commentary
The "Caw" almost certainly means that this is [[Mephisto]]. There's the comment that "This level of technology is beyond anything humans can manage right now", and we know that [[Sylus]] comes from [[Philos]] in the future. Though [[Mephisto]]'s specific origin is unclear, and the crow isn't mentioned in [[Land of Lost]], it's clear that the technology he uses is from the future.

This idea of a "primordial command, unyielding but devoid of malice" also evokes [[Sylus]]'s MO thematically.
