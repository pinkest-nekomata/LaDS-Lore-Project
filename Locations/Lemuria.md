An ancient, marine civilization recorded in legends. Its unique, advanced technologies are difficult to use. Also, [[Lemurian]]s had achieved great mastery over many art-related fields such as music, painting, literature, architecture, and carving.
In 2034, the ruins of an underwater city were discovered to the southeast of [[Linkon]] City, proving the existence of Lemuria.

## Conjecture
The ruins appeared in the same year as the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] and the appearance of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. There's a chance this is meant to hit at merging timelines/planets, but it's unclear whether the ruins were discovered before or after the tunnel appeared.
