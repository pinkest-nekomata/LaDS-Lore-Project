> "Some say that from a higher dimensional perspective, time doesn't exist. The past, present, and future all unfold in the same space. A person can only see the world before them because their eyes can only perceive the light projected from it. 
> If this is true, then somewhere in the vast cosmos, there might exist a point where light from countless timelines converges. From there, one could see every star that ever existed, from the explosion of the universe to its eventual collapse, and witness every possible ending the world could take under an infinite number of choices."
