[[Greyson]] reflects on the limits of their ability as doctors to save the hunters they care about.
## Summary
By following [[Greyson]] and his hunter crush, this story highlights the fear and anxiety of caring for a hunter. Greyson reflects on their limits as medical professionals, eventually wondering whether the families of patients who've died see them as guardian angels or [[Grim Reaper]]s. Zayne doesn't have an answer for this.

We also have the symbol of the [[snow velvet]] flower in [[Zayne]]'s office. They only grow on [[Mt Eternal]], and even there are going extinct. He's able to keep it alive with his [[Evol]]--but eventually it grows [[black crystals]], and he determines it to be beyond saving. This is a poignant parallel to his relationship with [[MC]], especially because in [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs]] he admits to himself that he'd do anything to keep her alive. Here, he must accept the limits with the snow velvet--but he knows he won't with her.

# 01 Crush
[[Greyson]] and [[Yvonne]] are working together after [[Zayne]]'s returned from a [[Mt Eternal]] trip.

An [[Arctic Hunter]] is in a wheelchair with a cast used for [[Wanderer]] injuries. The [[Arctic Trauma Center]] referred his case to [[Akso Hospital]]. He's got survivor's guilt and is eager to return to help his colleagues. [[Greyson]] reflects that hunters are particularly mission-minded, especially members of the [[Alpha Team]] for whom "a recommendation for further examiation is but a suggestion." ((this likely refers to [[MC]])) [[Greyson]] grills the [[Arctic Hunter]] about his life and hobbies, since he's got a crush on a hunter.

# 02 Sustenance

[[Greyson]] arrives at the conference room where [[Zayne]] is reviewing a case file with [[Dr. Wu]] from the [[Division of Evol and Protocore Medical Technology]].

> Yvonne: "Hey, regarding your hunter girl, why not take a cue from Dr. Zayne? He's so close with Miss Hunter! You know that saying her name turns him into a softie!"

Greyson heads over to Zayne's office after the meeting.

> Zayne: There's a Type-A Cryozina implant surgery tomorrow. Get ready.

This surgery is for the [[Arctic Hunter]] he met earlier.

> The [[Metaflux]] reaction in the patient's leg wound exceeds the reference limit and cannot be completely removed. Medical imaging results show that the residual [[Metaflux]] has entered the bloodstream. A Cryozina must be implanted as soon as possible to prevent the [[Metaflux]] from affecting the patient's heart even more.

They chat about the schedule, then [[Greyson]] reaches for a potted white flower bud (revealed to be [[snow velvet]] in chapter 04 below) on Zayne's desk, earning a smack. Greyson starts a roundabout way to ask Zayne about the hunters, but Zayne quickly intuits he's asking about a crush. They chat, and on the way out, Greyson notices Zayne use his Evol to revive the wilting bud.

# 03 In The Shadows
[[Greyson]] arrives to work in a fancy suit, and [[Yvonne]] correctly guesses he's trying to impress a hunter today during the routine hunter medical exams. Then a [[Metaflux]] leak alert sounds. Greyson hurries to the helipad to try to get a ride to the scene of the emergency, but the helicopter is just taking off. [[Zayne]] is always a step ahead. Greyson takes the next helicopter.

After two exhausting days, the rescue mission is winding down. Greyson is happy that the hunter he has a crush on is alright. He and [[Zayne]] chat, [[Zayne]] teasing him for not offering to do the heavy lifting for his crush. Greyson reflects sadly that his crush is stronger than him, and he's not sure how much help he'd actually be if she's in danger.

# 04 Snow Velvet
Back at [[Akso Hospital]], the surgery on the [[Arctic Hunter]] goes well. He asks if he can still be a hunter. Greyson is irritated at his impatience, but [[Zayne]] expects it.

> "Physical therapy starts in two weeks, and the stitches come out in four weeks. As for a bionic exoskeleton, that will be six to eight weeks. It depends on how your wound heals."

Zayne reminds the hunter that if he doesn't follow the recovery plan, he might "roll" out of the hospital (i.e. on a cart to the morgue). The matter-of-fact reminder of mortality works on the [[Arctic Hunter]].

Greyson helps the [[Arctic Hunter]] through his recovery, which goes well over the next couple of weeks. The hunter wants to thank [[Zayne]], and once in his office, recognizes the white flowers as [[snow velvet]]. He comments on how rare the flower is, then suggests that Zayne has a thing for "saving pretty things". ((This is pretty clearly meant to echo his relationship with [[MC]].))

# 05 A Long Night
The [[Arctic Hunter]] is discharged, and [[Greyson]] is writing the report for the routine hunter examinations. [[Greyson]] notices that an abnormal number of hunters are showing signs of Type-Y [[Protocore Syndrome]]. He alerts [[Andrew]] of the [[Data Analysis]] Sector at the [[Hunters Association]], who promises to factor this risk into mission assignments. Andrew's calm perturbs Greyson, as it hits too close to home.

He goes to [[Zayne]]'s office for comfort during the long night shift, and finds the [[snow velvet]] wilting. Where there was pristine snow at its base before there are now [[black crystals]] of ice. Zayne returns, and Greyson points out the wilting flower. But as soon as Zayne sees the crystals, he hesitates, and determines that the flower is beyond saving.

> "Dr Zayne, when we declare someone gone... In the eyes of their family, are we guardian angels or the [[Grim Reaper]]?"
> It's an unanswered question that hangs in the air. Zayne can't help but glance at the desk.
> A few fragile petals of the snow velvet fall, only with its tiny heart still desperately clinging to life amidst the black ice crystals.
