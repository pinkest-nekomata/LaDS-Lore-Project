On the 5th floor. [[Xavier's apartment]] is above it on the 6th floor.

The building is in the city center, within walking distance of the [[Bloomshore District]] (or potentially within the district). ([[Xavier]] and [[MC]] stop for noodles at [[Harmonious Mart]] on the way back during [[01-06.07 At Midnight]].)

There's an fenced courtyard with an outer door. The building itself says No.9 on the front.
