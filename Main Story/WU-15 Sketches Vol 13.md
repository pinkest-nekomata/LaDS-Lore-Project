[[Sketches]] editor [[Juniper]] spends a day with sci-fi author [[Yvette]] and learns about the history of [[Skyhaven]]--as well as hints of the [[Farspace Fleet]]'s darker side.

# Summary
((Since [[Yvette]] is 37 and was born in 2012, it must be early spring 2050.))

[[Juniper]] is an editor for the [[Sketches]] program and sets up an interview for their next subject, [[Yvette]], who played a significant role in creating [[Skyhaven]] and inspiring people to support it, but who has since distanced herself.

It's revealed that [[Skyhaven]]'s islands were originally ones from the earth, and then the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] caused gravity and magnetic anomalies that lifted them skyward, especially [[Whirlreef Island]]. Yvette used to be a resident, but didn't move to the island when it became part of [[Skyhaven]], recognizing that it fundamentally was no longer the same.

A guest lecture at [[Skyhaven University]] points at parallels between [[Protocore]] technology and the greed and hubris of early nuclear technology, and then a visit to the [[Farspace Fleet]] base reveals why [[Yvette]] put her feet back on the ground--her ex-husband is [[Liam]], [[Caleb]]'s now-robotic Adjutant. ((His personality change was due to the [[Toring chip]] and the Fleet's influence.))

Yvette's parting sentiment is best understood with the original CN in mind; She implies poetically that in chasing after [[Protocore]] technology, people like [[Liam]] have lost their own "cores", rendering them "coreless" which is pronounced the same as "heartless"("careless") in CN.


# 01 Featured Character

The story begins with a biography of [[Yvette]] (refer to that page for details), a bestselling sci-fi author and former [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] engineer.

The editor, [[Juniper]], notes that they've been running [[Sketches]] for a year, releasing monthly episodes that feature a day in the life of academic experts. When their producer prompted them to find a subject with more "mass appeal", a copy of "Cloud" on their shelf reminded them of [[Yvette]], which the producer also loved, and so they booked the interview.

# 02 Homeland
It's early spring, and [[Juniper]] and the camera crew arrive at [[Yvette]]'s home studio, conducting a surprisingly casual interview under the fragrant plum tree in her courtyard.

They chat about how [[Whirlreef Island]] became part of [[Skyhaven]] after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], but [[Yvette]] didn't take the chance to move into [[Skyhaven]] despite being a [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] engineer and working on the project herself. She noted that the island's climate and wildlife were part of what she loved about it, and those permanently changed when it floated into the sky.

She muses that she might also want to move to [[Windfall Tableland]] and its vast grasslands, or [[Azure Peak]] (mountains) or [[Aridum]] (desert). She expresses a "seize the day" type philosophy on  life.

Then, they head to [[Skyhaven University]] for [[Yvette]]'s guest lecture.

# 03 Central Theme

[[Yvette]]'s lecture starts with a "decade-old" [[Linkon]] News street interview about whether [[Skyhaven]] should be built, and the narrative reviews the controversy (see [[Skyhaven#Origin]] for details).

She then proceeds to stage a simulated interview with her younger self, introducing both versions:
* [[Yvette]], 27, Research Institute of the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]], Senior Engineer of the [[Skyhaven]] Initiative, science fiction author, and devoted Prototist
* [[Yvette]], 37, author, enjoys growing flowers and drinking tea, wastes time, harbors simple sentiments instead of grand ambitions

Yvette comments how the relationship between humanity and technology has been her "central theme" for five years (ie ages 22 to 27). 37 year old [[Yvette]] compares the eagerness for [[Protocore]]s to the eagerness for nuclear energy, which had disastrous results (comparing [[Protocore Syndrome]] to radiation sickness) for which 27 year old Yvette doesn't have an answer.

27 year old Yvette says she's working on Ever's [[Protocore]] development because she believes the era needs [[Protocore]]s, but she doesn't have an answer for 37 yo Yvette's question of whether humanity can be trusted--after all, nuclear technology wasn't originally developed for power generation.

The lecture ends on a thoughtful quote.

# 04 Cloud
[[Juniper]] follows [[Yvette]] to pick up her kids from school--they go to [[Skyhaven Elementary]].

They briefly discuss how [[Yvette]] feels about [[Cloud]] now. She says she was a dreamer, with her eyes in the sky--but now she's turned them back down to earth, and describes it as a "rough landing".

[[Juniper]] correctly guesses that it's not just because the utopian vision of [[Cloud]], where humanity would move to the sky and let the earth return to its natural rhythms, didn't happen, and that it's also connected to why she left the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]]. ((We soon learn that her ex-husband is [[Liam]], [[Caleb]]'s adjutant, who is one of the most robotic and dissociated of the [[Farspace Fleet]] officers.))

[[Yvette]] reveals that she and [[Liam]] (who has not yet been named) were high school sweethearts and joined the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] together.

As the kids arrive, [[Yvette]] offers to take them to the [[Skyhaven Ring]] (and, by extension, the [[Farspace Fleet command center]]) to see if they can visit their father, and invites [[Juniper]] along, saying it might shed some light on things.

# 05 Heartless

[[Juniper]] observes the strange reunion where the boy runs towards his father. [[Liam]] moves down to protect [[Caleb]], not initially recognizing his own son. Juniper notices wariness, unfamiliarity, hesitation, then neutrality. After seeking permission from Caleb, Liam awkwardly pats his son.

Caleb speaks:
> "Family is important, Adjutant [[Liam]]. Spend some time with them tonight." The commander's words are considerate, but his tone lacks any real emotion.

The daughter says "there's no need" (for Liam to spend time with them) because it will be boring and her brother will soon want to leave.

Caleb says she'll hurt her father's feelings saying things like that, to which the daughter says, "He won't care."

Caleb replies:
> "Hmm, like mother, like daughter."
> The commander gazes at [[Yvette]] with a perfectly measured smile, which she meets with ice in her eyes.
> "I want to know what's out there in deep space that makes you so willing to abandon everything here on Earth."
> "Humanity's problem was never about energy--it's about refusing to let go of what we already have, even when it's become worthless. A tethered kite will never reach the far sky, Ms. Yvette."
* ((Contrast this directly to [[Pathless Realm#03 Night Flight]] which specifically establishes the image of Caleb as a kite and MC as being/holding his string, and this being how he makes it back from his doomed Deepspace Tunnel trip. This comment foreshadows the personality changes caused by the [[Toring chip]].))

As her son returns to her, [[Yvette]] tells [[Caleb]] she's working on a new book called 'Heartless'. He wishes her success.

Afterward, [[Juniper]] asks whether [[Yvette]] trusts humans--she doesn't, but she trusts human nature, and that's why she believes humans will find a path beyond [[Protocore]] technology.

After 'Heartless' is published, [[Juniper]] asks if the title is related to [[Liam]]'s change, and [[Yvette]] replies that she named it that because 'heartless' rhymes with 'coreless'.
* Translation Notes (Machine translated via Google Translate):
	* In CN, she says that it's because the title of the book, 無心 (wúxīn, "careless") and 無芯 (wú xīn, "coreless") are pronounced the same
	* In CN, the title of the chapter is 無心 (wúxīn, "careless")
		* 心 can also be translated as "heart", "center", "core", "bosom", etc
	* Note that the character 芯 for "core" is the exact one used in "core technology" (**芯**核科技) and can also be translated as "wick" or "marrow".
	* "Heartless" better captures the full meaning of the CN 無心, since "Careless" usually means clumsy or disinterested in EN, a meaningfully different connotation. That said, "Careless"/"Coreless" captures the original wordplay more closely, and can be understood as "care-less" as in "not showing care or affection".
* Poetically, this wordplay implies that in searching out [[Protocore]] technology, humans are losing their own "cores", ie their human "hearts".
