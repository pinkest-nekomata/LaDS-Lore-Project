# Summary
While hiding, [[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] overhear more of the conversation between [[Maxwell]] and what's revealed to be two [[Ever]] representatives. When they ask him about buying the island, [[Jewel Reef]], he gets angry and the conversation results in veiled threats from [[Ever]].

When the coast seems to be clear, MC and Rafayel emerge, but Maxwell has lingered. To try to avoid suspicion, Rafayel pretends they were fighting, and MC plays along. It's at least enough that [[Maxwell]] doesn't have them detained, but he orders extra security (ruining their plan) and tells them to steer clear of the fourth floor.

# Details
In the storage area, [[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] huddle close and stay quiet. MC complains he's poking her, so he shifts but quarters are tight--he ends up almost holding her waist. The conversation continues above them:

> ?? (woman): ... originally wanted to attend, but he couldn't leave. He asked us to send you and your wife his regards.
> [[Maxwell]]: You're too kind...

Rafayel complains about them having this conversation at an inconvenient time, but MC says they should try to wait it out--they still have 7 or 8 minutes. But the cramped space is uncomfortable, and when [[Rafayel]] tries to help MC get hair out of her face, he ends up hitting the deck with his elbow and making a noise. But the conversation continues.

In a tender moment, Rafayel moves the hair tickling her face aside. She blushes. The conversation continues.

> ?? (man): Please think this over, [[Maxwell]]. As long as you're willing to give up [[Jewel Reef]], feel free to name your price.
> ?? (woman): This would be a great opportunity for you to collaborate with [[Ever]] again, don't you think? I'm sure your wife would agree.
> \[...]
> Maxwell: `(angrily)` I already told you. I'm never selling the island. Stop asking.
> ?? (woman): Maxwell, we've been very sincere. Being at each other's throats won't benefit anyone, right?
> Maxwell: Are you threatening me?!
> ?? (man): `(unconvincingly)` No, no. We wouldn't even consider it. But your anniversary *is* coming up. It'd be a shame if something went awry to ruin the event...

They argue a bit more, then leave. MC and Rafayel emerge back into the hallway. Maxwell comes back into view, so MC yanks Rafayel down to her, trying to hide. [[Maxwell]] sees them, so [[Rafayel]]'s acting skills kick in:
> Rafayel: Why are you crying? Are you feeling unwell? Or did I do something that made you upset?

MC quickly picks up the hint, pretending to be angry. Their pretend fight gives Maxwell pause, and [[Rafayel]] tries to play it off as a lovers' quarrel. Maxwell isn't entirely convinced, then a guard stops by. [[Maxwell]] tells him to up the security, stationing more men, and to carefully guard both the jewelry and the deed to [[Jewel Reef]].

Now that [[MC]] and [[Rafayel]]'s plan is ruined, they go to leave. On their way, Maxwell tells them to stay off the fourth floor. He recommends the bar or cafe on the fifth floor instead.
