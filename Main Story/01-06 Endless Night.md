# Summary
Back in [[Linkon]], [[MC]] tries to search the [[Hunters Association]] database for information on [[Onychinus]]. However, no results come back for the organization, despite [[Jenna]] having mentioned it before. Searches for the [[N109 Zone]] yield results, but only with generic information.

Meanwhile, [[Tara]] and [[Nero]] discuss rumors about [[Lumiere]]. Apparently, he bought a bunch of [[Protocore]]s off the [[Black Market]] about a month ago, then destroyed them all. [[MC]] later realizes she hasn't seen [[Xavier]] in about the past month, but doesn't put two and two together that he's [[Lumiere]]. After all, [[Lumiere]] would have to be in his 40s by this point.

On the way home, [[MC]] runs into [[Xavier]] napping on the train. He tells her another urban legend--that ends up being sort of true. When the train pulls into the station it just left, they realize they're trapped together on the train with a [[Tezcatlipoca]], a type of [[Wanderer]] that can hide in glass and mirrors. This is the same type of [[Wanderer]] that only [[Lumiere]] could defeat during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. ((This is the third of the [[traps for Xavier]].))

An exhausted [[Xavier]] opts to destroy all the glass on the train and in the station in one blow, forcing the [[Tezcatlipoca]] into battle. He and [[MC]] defeat the [[Wanderer]]. They then walk home together, and realize that they live in the same building. Eventually, [[Xavier]] decides that he'll tell [[MC]] more of what he knows about the [[N109 Zone]].

The next morning, [[Xavier]] confirms that the [[modified Protocore]] from [[No-Hunt Zone 7]], as well as the [[Protocore]] he examined in the [[abandoned base for Protocore research]], were both modified by [[Onychinus]] with an [[Aether Core]]. He then gives [[MC]] a temporary pass for the highest level of access in the [[Hunters Association]] for 24 hours, allowing her to continue her research.

## Commentary
The title "Endless Night" likely refers to the [[N109 Zone]], which [[MC]] learns about in this chapter. There's also the loop that the train is caught in, and a general connection to the concept of the "dark night of the soul" related to MC's grief at the loss of her family.
