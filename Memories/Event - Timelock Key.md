# Sylus: Shadowed Past
***Sealed Realm***
## 1
First Image: Sylus stands in front of the stained glass of the chapel as birds fly by.

> Observe

Second Image: The [[Deepspace Tunnel]] appearing over [[Linkon]], and the top of a skyscraper crumbling as if being drawn up into the tunnel.

> Ruins groan in the wind, and screams tear through the silence.
> A long journey reaches a new destination.
> He arrives at the most inopportune moment.
> Buildings collapse and order crumbles, yet this brings him a newfound pleasure.
> "...Heh. Interesting."
> His words sink into the dust as his figure vanishes into the darkness. An entirely new beginning awaits him.

## 2
First Image: Sylus stands in front of the [[Deepspace Collision Chamber]], hand outstretched, where [[MC]] floats as a child.

> Release

Second image: Sylus's hand silhouetted over a swirling ball of light and shadow that resembles a celestial body.

> Silence replaces fury, which unfolds into an eerily calm reunion.
> The once unruly enemy from his memories now has clipped wings.
> With all vulnerabilities exposed, she's curled up before him.
> This slaughter had been rehearsed countless times.
> He raises his arm with great precision.
> Bang!
> One the deafening sound fades, he retreats and goes back the way he came.
> Behind him, the pod imprisoning the girl slowly opens to offer an escape route.
> The past remains unsettled as the curtain quietly rises on a new entanglement.

## 3
First image: An adult Sylus stands before the [[interstellar arena]] with a [[Wanderer]] at the center. A cheering crowd surrounds him.

> Memories

Second image: The image zooms into the arena, and a boy stands at the center.

> The crowd erupts into revelry and celebrates the arrival of another death. He gazes at the battlefield where slaughter is about to unfold.
> Fragments that should've been forgotten suddenly surface. In the gladiatorial cage, they stood face-to-face. Their vows resonate with sincerity.
> "We'll escape this place together."
> "Yes, we will."
> But fate always works against humanity. It witnessed their desperate pursuit of light...
> While simultaneously pushing them deeper into the darkness.

## 4
First image: Sylus sits in a red chair with a glass of wine, seen from the side. The checkerboard floor is tilted. In the foreground, shattering chess pieces fly across the screen. A chandelier sways. In the background, past arch-shaped windows and curtains, are a pair of silhouettes of two men choking each other.

> Sovereign

The perspective shifts to show Sylus head-on, sitting in the red throne-like chair before a set of stairs. The same chandelier sways above. The window behind him reveals a red background. In the foreground, silhouettes seem to either kneel or cower before him.

> Sharp edges lurk beneath crimson eyes. They silently corrode everything.
> Amused, he watches as humanity rises and falls. They race one another to plunge into the abyss of desire. But he's like a fiend strolling leisurely through purgatory.
> Under the cover of darkness, he slowly approaches a throne. A crown woven from schemes and ambition gently falls next to his feet.

## 5
First image: Sylus holds a watering can over daturas that hang limp. The window in the background shows this is a greenhouse. A black curtain sweeps across the top of the frame.

> Cultivation

Second image: A black datura glows white, then twists tight into a bud.

> Tilling soils, adding fertilizer, maintaining warmth, watering...
> He holds his breath, and a rare instance of anticipation flickers in his eyes. But barren land cannot harbor hope, and a cursed soul is destined to never solve life's riddle.
> In an instant, withered flowers cover the ground again. They're surrounded by deathly silence.
> "They just don't bloom at this time." The whisper dissolves into the wind.

## 6
First image: Crows fly across the foreground, with skyscrapers in the background. Silhouettes of Sylus and MC face different directions, with MC's further away.

> Farewell

Second image: Sylus's silhouette is in the foreground facing MC's in the background, running past him. A flock of birds fills the scene.

> His footsteps startle a flock of birds, and they fly away. With a downcast gaze, he withdraws from the bustling city center.
> "Mission accepted. I'm on my way!"
> As they brush past each other, his steps falter involuntarily.
> A cold premonition cuts through his heart as a familiar silhouette disappears in his periphery.
> It's reminiscent of an absurd prank and a coincidence of fate. Perhaps their reunion is closer than it appears.

# Zayne: Fates Entwined
***Veiled Mysteries***

## 1
First image: Silhouette of Zayne as a boy reaching out towards a giant, monstrous clawed hand. A branch with white blossoms hangs down from the top, and snowflakes swirl.

> Awakening

Second image: In the foreground, Zayne stands amidst a field of flowers. More branches come down from the top of the frame, and there's a flowered archway past him. In the distance, just closer than the archway, three adults push an emergency medical stretcher holding a body, one of them hanging an IV bag. Falling petals resemble snow.

> Sunlight intertwines with shadows falling from above. Everything seems to sway between reality and oblivion.
> The scene before him collapses into a vortex deep within his gaze as gods look down upon the mortal world.
> Upon weaving the first connection with that youth... Icy thorns pierce his palm.
> The girl's figure shatters, and blood crystallizes into amber.
> Like raging waves finally breaking through fragile ice--Ever since then, all his dreams were enshrouded in darkness.

## 2
First image: Zayne and MC stand in a house, within a threshold. In the foreground, a chair is visible along with potted plants. Jasmin blooms fall near the bottom of the frame.

> Evading 

Second image: Their hands hang near each other. His pinky extends, her index finger reaches towards him, but they don't touch. Her reach extends over the midpoint of the frame, but his doesn't.

> Twilight washed away her chaotic memories, and her old wounds sank into an abyss untouched by light and shadow.
> Yet in his heart, an impenetrable fog remains.
> He can neither see anything past it nor find a way to leave.
> Their fingertips almost touch, yet they stay suspended...
> They're ultimately unable to cross that invisible boundary.
> Using his own hands, he tears open a wound--one with a newly formed scab.
> Until he finds redemption, he shall willingly imprison himself within this pain.
> Like a traveler with a lamp, he cannot let the faint light die out before he escapes the darkness.

## 3
First image: Zayne and MC at the railing of the seal exhibit at the aquarium. A cute round seal, just like the ones Zayne made from ice, leans against the railing.

> Parting

Second image: The familiar seal has been placed in front of a closed front door. Jasmin petals blow on the wind.

> Ripples of light dance across clear waters as a graceful figure moves between them. They're like fireflies slowly drifting through a dark blue expanse.
> She immerses herself completely... And greedily savors the first bright, beautiful season she's experienced in years.
> Yet the path beneath his feet will inevitably stretch toward more distant horizons. Too many unknowns are waiting. They're waiting for him to tread into their midst.
> As gentle breezes rise and fall... He can only fold an entire summer into a farewell and offer it as a gift to her.
> Although it was merely a moment of warmth... It remains his only ember and lighthouse as he trudges through the desolate, cold years ahead.

## 4
First image: An anatomical heart sits in center frame with spiky black crystals emerging as a shattering sound effect plays. Around it are fragments of DNA helixes.

> Destruction

Second image: Zayne stands next to a lab workbench. Below his feet are scattered papers. Shadows extend from him in all directions. More papers blow across the foreground.

> After hesitating for a moment, he finally casts a stone into the barren well between life and death. [[Black crystals]] rapidly climb up the veins of his heart. Like tendrils lurking in the abyss, they coldly drain away all warmth.
> Thump. Thump. The sound echoes within the crystalline cluster.
> That heart which bears deadly temptation and danger...
> It beats, growing more violent by the second.
> He clutches the key to reversing life and death. Even after seeing such a miracle...
> Resolved, he closes that door without any regrets. The world around him returns to silence, and his faith remains untarnished.
> Yet that alien darkness has already taken root in his soul.

## 5
First image: Zayne stands in his seat in a lecture hall, surrounded by a couple other students. Behind him, broad windows reveal verdant tree branches.

> Vow

Second image: He stands at the head of a group of students, holding a book and standing at a microphone, to recite the hippocratic oath. Above them hangs an atom-like piece of art that also resembles an orrery.

> "I will have the utmost reverence for human life, maintain a sense of duty and dignity in practicing medicine, and adhere to good medical standards..."
> This resounding oath is like an invisible cord.
> It tightly binds his dreams to his responsibilities.
> His gaze traverses those long years to this sacred moment... It's like the breaking dawn that illuminates the night.
> His naive search ended, and he became a true guardian of life. The mystery that had troubled him so deeply...
> Perhaps it had already begun to silently sketch the outline of truth.

## 6

First image: Zayne climbs a staircase in the [[Fractal Library]].

> Revelation

Second image: Zayne floats high in the [[Fractal Library]], silhouetted against golden light. Constellations and planets hang around him. In the foreground, books hover with open pages, flipping as if stirred by a wind.

> Pages flutter in the air. The future and the past intertwine...
> Like a serene yet magnificent chant from the dawn of creation.
> Each page records stories forgotten by time. They finally find their place in perpetual cycles.
> Images dance before his eyes. Blood surges in his chest...
> It's as if a rift in the universe opened for just a second. He sees himself walking across the torrent of time.
> Divine whispers pierce through eternal silence. And this indispensable guardian... Finally touches the unspoken covenant.
