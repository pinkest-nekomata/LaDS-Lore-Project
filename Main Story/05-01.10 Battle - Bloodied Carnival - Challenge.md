**Description**
> A bloodied carnival plays out on every street corner of Charon. To carve out any chance of survival here, one must eliminate the endlessly emerging Wanderers.

*Note: Per the notes in [[Guangzhou Tianhe Mall Ad]], "carnival" is an alternate translation of the same word more frequently translated to "revelry", so this "bloodied carnival" can be understood as a direct reference to Sylus's "revelry" theme.*
