**Description**
> Shortly after I learned that Sylus had been invited to [[His Highness]]'s birthday party on [[Tulla Island]], he suddenly appeared in [[Linkon]] City. He whisked me away in his car, heading toward an unknown destination...

# Summary
Sylus whisks MC away to one of his armories on the outskirts of [[Linkon]], the [[Antiques Villa]] deep in the forest. This is where he keeps his older weapons, and he's there to pick out a "present" for [[His Highness]]. The theme of their conversation becomes how he's always "pestering" her, and how she may get her wish of being left alone. MC expresses concern in a roundabout way, revealing that she suspects the [[Tulla Island]] invitation may be a trap for Sylus. He ends up selecting her gun to use as his "present".

A few days later, breaking news reveals an explosion on Tulla Island. MC tries to contact Sylus, but can't get through to him. Tara notices how worried she is, and MC realizes that she doesn't actually mind being "pestered". That day, Sylus appears across the street to return her gun. MC tells him that her agreeing to the bet was a "joke" and he's not allowed to make bets like that in the future. This is a key milestone of her accepting him into her life.

# Key Info
* Sylus's file with the [[Hunters Association]] is top secret, and Sylus knows this
	* MC put significant work into accessing the file, saying she "pulled a few strings"
* Sylus has a villa in the forests near [[Linkon]], [[Antiques Villa]], see also [[Sylus's nests]]
* This is a key turning point where MC stops seeing Sylus as being a nuisance and always bringing trouble--she realizes she'd truly miss him if he didn't return.

# Trivia
* There's a key shipping route near [[Tulla Island]] that [[Sylus]] needs to retain control of.
