**Description**
> Next time when flowers bloom, I want you to still be by my side.

# Summary
While at a botanical garden owned by [[Rafayel]]'s friend [[Charles]], they revisit the unnamed ocean-blooming flower species that was once extinct. MC is still supposed to come up with a name. MC expresses anxiety that Rafayel might one day return to the sea without her--[[Rafayel]] assures her.

Two weeks later, Rafayel's exhibition has its final stop in [[Linkon]]. MC picked a venue where nature reclaimed a tourist area and visitors can take a train across a mirror-like lake to the exhibition. Rafayel surprises MC with his early return, gifting her a new dress. They head out to check out the venue and paint the train with an ocean theme, then take it across the lake to a wisteria grove. The kindled scene depicts Rafayel sketching wisteria for the centerpiece of his exhibition.

Half a month later, the exhibition is held. The sapphire buds are featured, distributed to guests in glass jars. Once dipped under the lake's water, the buds bloom. Rafayel suggests the name of this new flower should be... MC's name.

# Quotes

> Rafayel: Returning to the ocean is a [[Lemurian]] tradition, but not everyone is the same. Our hearts are bound to different things. I understand what it's like to wait for someone to keep their promise. That's why I only make promises I know I can keep.

> Rafayel: I know you weren't... exactly being honest when you decided to change the subject. But when you have these feelings next time... Can you tell me about them in the same way you did today? When you start thinking about those things, I'll be by your side to support you. Will that make you feel better?

> Rafayel: Sometimes I think that... what I believed to be an ending might not really be the end, you know. It's like how a river flowing into the sea doesn't actually end. The seawater will become rain and fall again. No one knows where the end is or whether things will end in the next moment. What we think has left us has just found another way to spend by our side. Maybe I should cherish the journey I share with the people around me instead of searching for endings. 

> Rafayel: An artist isn't a camera. What's on the paper isn't always what the eye sees. Maybe I'm drawing a love story.

> Rafayel: The wisteria tells a fantastical tale of devoted, gentle love... In this story, the wisteria represents... our precious moment.

> Rafayel: What does wisteria symbolize in the language of flowers?
> MC: It... represents an enduring, intensely devoted love and the desire to never part from the one you cherish. I chose this place because I learned what the flowers meant.
> Rafayel: The language of flowers has never been about interpreting the plants themselves. Rather, it's about giving voice to the emotions we carry in our hearts.

> Rafayel: Whenever I show up at one of my exhibitions, [[Thomas]] is always the happiest person around.

> Rafayel: From this moment onward, the deep sea won't be able to separate us. And I want the meaning of this flower to be... "To never part ways."
