A troubled fleet officer killed by [[Caleb]] in [[04-01.02 Above the Clouds]].

[[Joseph]] was controlled by the [[Toring chip]] and made to be a scapegoat for the [[Cascade District explosion]]. During [[04-01.02 Above the Clouds]], [[Caleb]] provides the version of events that the [[Farspace Fleet]] wants to circulate. A few pieces of this story seem to be fact:
* Three years ago, Joseph was selected for a year-long extended [[Deepspace Tunnel]] observation mission
* He completed the mission with outstanding performance
* Extended cosmic radiation can cause a variety of mental and physical symptoms, which Joseph may or may not have experienced.
* Two months ago, Joseph's behavior became suspicious. He appears to have locked his wife and child in the Fleet's brig, leading to their death. 
	* Caleb blames this on [[Cybezin]] overdose, but [[Joseph]] claims he was being manipulated via the [[Toring chip]]
* He arrived at the [[Farspace Fleet command center]] with explosives and a detonator at the time of this event--perhaps under Fleet influence, or perhaps in an effort to get revenge for being under the Fleet's control
* He's blamed for the [[Cascade District explosion]] which happened one week prior
* Caleb kills him and absorbs the detonator with a black hole.
