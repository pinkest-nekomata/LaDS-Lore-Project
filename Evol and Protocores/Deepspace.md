As with many elements of the game, the concept of "deep space" borrows from real-world science (see also [deep space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_space_exploration)). Essentially, "deep space" just means distant space--far beyond our solar system.

In the game's lore, the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] allows for receiving signals from Deepspace, as well as travel into Deepspace, including to/from [[Philos]].
