# Spacepedia
Hailing from [[Xavier]]'s hometown, this group once included members like [[Xavier]], [[Jeremiah]], and [[Soren]]. They had many companions in the past, but now only a few remain.

# Other Info

They're from [[Philos]], in the future.

There was a "mistake" in their destination.
* In [[Xavier's trailer]], he mentions that it's his 214th spring on Earth--and his last.
* In [[Xavier academy anecdote]], the time is set 214 years after [[Philos]] was founded.
* This implies:
	* Earth will fail and Philos will be born sooner rather than later
	* The Backtrackers meant to arrive on Philos 214 years *after* Earth fell, so as to save [[Academy MC]] before she died. By accident, they arrived 214 years *before* Earth fell, and have been waiting for [[MC]]'s era since then.
