This is a recurring theme in [[01 Under Deepspace]]. MC puts two and two together in [[01-08.03 Luminous Veil]]. At that point, MC has observed four different "traps" set for Xavier:
* The [[Luminivore]]s (and the related [[Flux Nexus]]) at the [[abandoned base for Protocore research]] (In [[01-01 To Begin]])
* The space-distorting [[Wanderer]]s, [[Aeonwyrm]], and [[Flux Nexus]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] (In [[01-03 Talented Hunter]])
* The [[Tezcatlipoca]] on the train, which is a powerful [[Wanderer]] that only [[Xavier]] (as [[Lumiere]]) was able to defeat before (In [[01-06 Endless Night]])
* The [[patrol robot]]s that they then take out in [[01-08.03 Luminous Veil]]

In [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#06 Dust]], the [[duckbill cap man]], who's confirmed to be one of the [[Backtrackers]] who turned traitor, refers to Xavier being "busy dealing with his own issues", hinting at [[duckbill cap man]] being involved in these traps.
