First main story appearance in [[01-01.08 Doctor]].

"I met [[Zayne]] after [[Grandma]] took me in. I was eight years old then. Our families had been friends for years, so we'd occasionally get together for meals. We didn't meet again until half a year ago, during a follow-up checkup on the [[Protocore fragments]] in my heart. I would've never guessed that after not seeing him for more than a decade, he'd reappear a my primary care physician." -- [[MC]], [[01-01.08 Doctor]]

"A fast resting heart rate. What riled you up this time?" -- [[Zayne]], [[01-01.08 Doctor]]

In [[01-02.03 Powder Keg]], [[MC]] notices that his hand has countless faint scars. Later, we learn that this is caused when his [[Evol]] gets out of control and crystals pierce his skin.

He won the [[Starcatcher Award]] and is the youngest person to receive the [[Linde Award]].
