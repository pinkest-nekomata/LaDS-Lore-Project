# Summary
As [[Zayne]] and [[Greyson]] check on the patient, [[Carter]] appears and gives enough detail to confirm the patient was part of [[X-Heart]]. He tries and fails to pique her interest. Greyson calls her into the ICU, sending Carter away.

With the patient, MC begins her questions about the [[Aether Core]]. The patient reports being trapped in a nightmare, and recognizes an image of [[Myst]]. As he does so, fluctuations occur, engulfing the room. The [[Wanderer]] appears, and as [[MC]] and [[Zayne]] try to fight it, white mist engulfs the room.

## Commentary
[[Carter]]'s description of this patient's relationship with [[Xander Sciences]] is almost identical to how he talks about [[X-Heart]], though he doesn't say the name here.

# Details
In the ICU, [[Zayne]] speaks with a nurse. It's still unclear why the patient is awake already, but all his vital signs are improving. Zayne and Greyson go to check on him. MC waits in the hall--and [[Carter]] arrives. He plays nice, and reveals that the patient was a client of [[Xander Sciences]]. It's clear that Carter is talking about an [[X-Heart]] patient. He tries to spark MC's curiosity, to no avail.
> Carter: It's okay, you'll be interested someday. After all, only [[Xander Sciences]] can provide answers to the questions about your heart.

[[Greyson]] summons MC into the ICU, sending [[Carter]] away.

In the ICU, the patient is excited to be recovering, but [[Zayne]] is still concerned. MC talks to him, ready to ask questions about the [[Aether Core]]. The patient reveals he was trapped in a nightmare. He recognizes the image of a Myst as being there in the nightmare--saying it was inside of him, but not. Then he lets out an anguished noise and starts convulsing. A [[Metaflux]] fluctuation engulfs the room.

Zayne calls for resuscitation on the patient. A rift appears, and the [[Wanderer]] emerges. MC tries to shoot it, but it teleports. She dodges an attack from behind with Zayne's help, then shoots for the center of the fluctuation. White fog surges and obscures her vision. The last thing she sees is Zayne rushing toward her. She warns him to watch out.
