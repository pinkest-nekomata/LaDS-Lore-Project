[[Nero]] *almost* figures out that [[Xavier]] is [[Lumiere]]

## Summary
This takes place after the completion of [[01 Under Deepspace]], as the events of [[01-08.03 Luminous Veil]] and [[01-08.04 Battle - Without a Trace]] are mentioned as the "[[Azure Square]] attack".

It's a lighthearted anecdote that describes [[Nero]] *almost* figuring out that [[Xavier]] is [[Lumiere]]--and then missing the obvious conclusion, instead deciding that [[Xavier]] must be one of [[Lumiere]]'s biggest fans.

Notably, there's a clue buried in this story that [[duckbill cap man]] may have been skulking around [[Philo]], and some additional information about [[Xavier]]'s [[suppression collar]].

# 01 A More Important Matter
[[Tara]] tries to convince [[Nero]] to join a team building event, coaxing him with the promise of seeing a rare [[Wanderer]]. But he backs out at the last second, distracted by the only thing he loves more--an update on [[Lumiere]]. The mysterious hunter is still on the top 10 list.

# 02 Sleepless Friday Night
Classic internet nerd (/affectionate) shenanigans occur. A "troll" is posting information to cast doubt on [[Lumiere]]'s character in the online fan forum, Lightchasers.

The first "evidence" is a grainy photo showing someone wearing a [[Lumiere]] outfit in the [[N109 Zone]].
* ((This has a chance at being [[Xavier]], since [[01-06.01 Legendary Lumiere]] hints at him going into the [[N109 Zone]] to destroy [[Protocores]].))

Security footage shows a hooded figure appearing near a florist's in a flash of light. Notably, the [[Light Evol]] is extremely rare, and the physique matches [[Lumiere]]'s. But when he lowers his hood, his face is wrinkled.
* This is most likely [[duckbill cap man]], based on the Light Evol and the wrinkles. (In [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#06 Dust]], he's noted as having the Light Evol and wrinkled hands.)
* Another of the [[Backtrackers]] would likely have a similar physique to [[Xavier]]
* If we trust [[Nero]]'s analysis that he posts on the forum, then this version of the Light Evol is different than [[Xavier]]'s.

# 03 The Introvert Bites Back
[[Nero]] continues to dispel the troll's rumors. A rumor that [[Lumiere]] would be at [[Azure Square]]'s grand opening (which [[Jeremiah]] attended in [[WU-04 From The Stars#04 Catastrophe]]) was started by fans. A photo that's described as [[Lumiere]] letting a [[Wanderer]] off the hook shows he was actually working to defeat it--and fled when a photographer tried to capture the moment. [[Lumiere]] is shown to destroy [[Protocore]]s (a key trait of [[Xavier]]).

Hilariously, the troll does mention the train incident from [[01-06.04 Loop of Mirrors]] and an "[[Azure Square]] attack" which is a reference to [[01-08.03 Luminous Veil]] and [[01-08.04 Battle - Without a Trace]], accusing [[Lumiere]] of planning these as publicity stunts to drum up support and blaming "the other person fighting alongside [[Lumiere]]" (ie [[MC]]) as the true mastermind.

[[Nero]] starts to piece together that the thread uniting the destroyed protcores, the [[Tezcatlipoca]] sighting and the [[Azure Square]] attack is his often-absent [[Alpha Team]] colleague, [[Xavier]]...

# 04 Has the Light Vanished?
Next, the "troll" posts some classified documents that actually describe [[Xavier]]'s [[suppression collar]]. (Details are on that page.) The documents describe the exact behavior of the glowing red collar seen in the main story. Though the Association techies couldn't entirely figure it out, they were able to increase the power threshold. [[Nero]] recognizes the tassel earring in the photo provided of the collar, and worries that [[Lumiere]] might be dead.

Hilariously, [[Xavier]] stumbles across him at this point, and [[Nero]] shoves the picture at him. Xavier tries to tell him not to worry about it and to go home, but Nero starts to hyperventilate. Xavier assures him that Lumiere is probably fine. [[Nero]] is not assured, ironically stating, "You... don't understand him at all."

# 05 A Little Chat
Two weeks later, [[Lumiere]] is still ranked in the top 10 hunters. [[Nero]]'s username ranks as well, thanks to his defense of Lumiere.

[[Nero]] then runs into [[Xavier]], referencing the three incidents where only [[Xavier]] is the common thread, and says, "You're Lumiere... 's ultimate fan, right?" He also references [[Xavier's limited myth]] when he says "You pulled some strings for that movie gig, didn't you?"

Finally, [[Nero]] promises to send [[Xavier]] any new info on [[Lumiere]], now that he "knows" he's a fellow "fan".
