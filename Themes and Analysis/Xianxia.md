Xianxia is a genre of Chinese fiction.

From [ImmortalMountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/glossary/wuxia-xianxia-xuanhuan-terms/):
> **Xianxia** (仙侠 xiānxiá) – literally means “Immortal Heroes”. Fictional stories featuring magic, demons, ghosts, immortals, and a great deal of Chinese folklore/mythology. Protagonists (usually) attempt to cultivate to Immortality, seeking eternal life and the pinnacle of strength. Heavily inspired by Daoism

The game blends both Eastern and Western genre tropes, but EN players may be missing some key context from CN tropes that help things make senes. Some key concepts are gathered her, and references to Xianxia tropes exist throughout this project.

Note that these concepts serve as inspiration and cultural touchpoints for the lore of the game, not as rules. Many things are reinterpreted and mixed with Western concepts. For example, cultivator cores, also known as Gold Cores, are connected to the concept of the [[Aether Core]]. Traditionally, these cores "form" in the lower abdomen. In the game's lore, MC's [[Aether Core]] forms around her heart, connecting the idea of her [[cultivation]] to the game's core theme of love and soul connections.

# Key Concepts
* [[cultivation]] is the process of becoming immortal, undertaken by heroes. It's a key goal and driving force in the genre.
* [[Cores in Xianxia]] add significant context to [[Protocore]]s and [[Aether Core]]s, hinting towards the broader significance of MC's Aether Core, for example.
