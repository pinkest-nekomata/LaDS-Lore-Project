> "It helps me see what people want the most. It exposes the desires that they refuse to admit."

# Spacepedia
[[Sylus]] has an [[Aether Core]] in his eye, which allows him to see people's desires.
It turns out there's more than one [[Aether Core]] in the world.

((See commentary below for nuance here.))

# Other Info
When Sylus's Eye is activated, it glows red. Whispers arise in the subject's mind, speaking their true desires.

[[05-01.04 The Match]] seems to imply that his eye also glows whenever his own desire surges, as it does when he senses the [[Spatium Core]] in [[MC]].

Known powers:
* Awakening hidden desires ([[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], [[Land of Lost]])
* Mind control/mental domination ([[Land of Lost]])
* Sensing latent desire in the area ([[Final Farewell]])

## Commentary

### Dragon Core
The Spacepedia entry is from MC's perspective, so it may not be strictly accurate that his eye's power is an [[Aether Core]] like hers. When she asks Sylus if that's what his eye is, he sighs and says, "Sure. Think of it like that." ([[02-02.06 Agreement]]) Later, when she asks about his "fusion with a [[Protocore]]" compared to hers, he says "my situation holds little value as a reference point." ([[05-01.04 The Match]])

Given that an "Aether Core" is essentially any particularly powerful Protocore, there's no real contradiction here, but there's reason to avoid generalizing Sylus's abilities to other Aether Cores. 

Notably, in [[Xianxia]], dragons are one of the types of mystical/divine beasts that can be born with a "Beast Core". Applying that trope, as a dragon, Sylus would have been born with his core vs. needing to undergo [[cultivation]] as MC does with. her 'Cultivation Core'. See also [[Cores in Xianxia]].
