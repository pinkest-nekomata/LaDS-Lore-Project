# Name's origin
This is a reference to the Elysium from Greek myth, the place where heroic souls go to rest in peace ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium)). Since it's connected to the afterlife, it's also connected to Hades, who rules the underworld. The parallel to [[Sylus]] ruling the [[N109 Zone]] is clear.
