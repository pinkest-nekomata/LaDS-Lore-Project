# Summary
MC disguises herself as a soldier and joins the forces marching to Tarus. Once there, she slips away and remembers the prediction about the [[black chapel]]. She steals a horse and races through the woods, finding the dragon bleeding on the chapel's altar.

She calms him by singing her [[requiem]], and as Sylus comes to his senses, there's a struggle of wills. He guides her hand toward the killing blow, but she refuses. He bites then soothes, grabs then caresses, eventually gently kissing her forehead in a callback to their moment on the top of the lair.

He tells her that she's his fated archnemesis, destined to kill her. She replies that she's greedy, and if Fate tells her to kill the Fiend, she'll save him instead. She begins to pour her power into him--and he warns her that by doing so, she'll have to pay the cost. They'll have to give each other half their souls, forging an unbreakable bond through life and death.

Without hesitation, she does so. He asks her to stay by his side until the end of time, and then they fall asleep together.

## Commentary

# Details
> The sight of the dragon rampaging through the city and flying off toward [[Tarus]] City haunts every soul that day. 
> When I finally break free from the chaos of the Legion and rush out of the Sanctuary, I only see his figure disappearing into the storm clouds.
> The trail of blood left along his flight path makes people realize--the Fiend is gravely injured.
> Soon, every faction of the Legion and every opportunist seeking to profit from the death of a dragon heads for Tarus City.
> I steal the armor of a dead soldier and blend into the ranks. I make my way over to the dragon as quickly as I can.
> I need to reach him before anyone else does, before they try to end him.
> Even if fate just showed me--I'm the only one who can truly kill him.

> *When I arrive at Tarus City, I see nothing but soaring flames. The dragon's lair on the cliff has been reduced to rubble.*
> MC: (How could this have happened...?!)
> *The [[Legion of Justitia]] have set up numerous traps and ambushes along the way. I hear the shouts carried by the wind.*
> Soldier: The fiend is wounded! He can't have gone far. Keep looking!
> MC: (But where could he be... He's not in Tarus City. And he's definitely not in the Abyss. What other places...)
> *The brand on my neck burns with a pain from deep within my soul. It's pulling the soul fragment the dragon left inside my body. My gaze unconsciously drifts across the withered forest and lands on the obsidian spire that has partially collapsed.*

MC remembers the blind merchant saying the Fiend would meet his destined archnemesis at the [[black chapel]]. (Now, she finally knows she's the only one who can kill him.) She steals a horse and races to the chapel.

> *The closer I get to the building, the more vivid the crimson bloodstains along the mountain path become. The horns and shouts for the dragon slowly fade, leaving only the rapid hoofbeats and my anxious heartbeat to fill the silence. By the time I reach the obsidian steps, the tiny stream of blood has nearly dried. 
> When I push open the gates of the long-abandoned chapel nestled deep within the forest, the cold moon hangs high in the night sky.
> The bright light filters through the shattered spire. Dazed, I see the dragon, barely alive. He lies in the center of the room.*
> MC: ... Sylus!
> *There's no reply. I run over to him and pay no attention to the [[Legion of Justitia]] who have died to his claws. On the raised platform, the dragon's eyes are closed. His body is drenched in blood, the droplets dripping from the edge.*
> MC: How could this be... Aren't your wounds supposed to heal fast?!
> *I try to stem the bleeding, but it's futile. His chest--*
> MC: (This... is the wound I gave him...)
> *All his wounds remain as-is. They don't show any signs of healing.
> A sudden roar resounds as the dragon opens his eyes. A fierce gale pushes me back and slams me against a pillar.*
> MC: !
> *A sharp, metallic taste fills my mouth. His fangs are at my neck, puncturing my skin. One more push, and he'd snap my spine.*
> MC: Sylus. Sylus... You're Sylus...
> *The mark on my shoulder boils with the agony only death could deliver. I suppress my fear, lift my trembling hand, and gently place it on the dragon's eye. A soft [[requiem]] echoes within the spacious room. The roaring slowly subsides, as if something deep inside him stirs awake. The dragon begins to struggle violently. The bestial chaos in his eyes clears. When the song ends, his gaze finally reflects my face.*
> MC: Sylus...
> *I close my eyes and press my lips against the dragon's. A moment later, a familiar figure appears before me. His lashes flutter as he stumbles, collapsing with me onto the cold floor.*
> MC: Sylus... Sylus! Wake up! Don't fall asleep... Sylus!
> *Black mist spills out from every wound in his body as if his very life is being drained away.
> Our blood mixes together on the slippery, cold floor. When my blood touches his chest that's shrouded in black mist, a sharp pain pierces my mind.*
> MC: Eat him... he's yours... Kill him... Devour... The power...
> *Exhilarated, my heart races. Fervent desire reverberates in my ears. My arm trembles as I raise it. Unable to control it, my hand is close to Sylus's heart.*
> MC: Yes... Use your strength... Just like that...
> *My hand quivers uncontrollably. I grit my teeth, trying to shake off the voice in my mind, but suddenly, my wrist is caught.*
> Sylus: Don't know where to aim?
> *Sylus had opened his eyes without me noticing. As he presses my wrist down, a faint, weak smirk curves his lips.*
> Sylus: `(Whispered)` I can tell you.
> *The phantom of the greatsword nearly forms again. It feels like waking from a trance, and I fling his hand away, breathless.*
> MC: Have you gone mad?!
> *A smile gradually graces Sylus's face. His eyes gleam like precious gemstones in the depths of darkness.*
> Sylus: What about you? Before the mark disappears, you still have a chance to kill me.
> *He tightly grips my arm and struggles to support himself in the pool of blood. Leaning against the pillar, his tail reaches out to me.*
> Sylus: `(Whispered, labored)` You've got it right at my heart. So why hesitate?
> *Struggling to breathe, I kneel before him as I'm forced to meet his gaze. His tail moves before I can react. My heartbeat reverberates in my ears. His aura burns like flames and slowly engulfs me.*
> Sylus: Do you remember? Only the Fiend's destined archnemisis can kill him. Who exactly do you think that is?
> *An inexplicable raging inferno surges within me. Indignant, I laugh. I open my mouth and sink my teeth into his hand.*
> Sylus: Ngh...!
> MC: I don't believe in this destined archnemisis nonsense!
> *Moonlight boils in his eyes. Sylus cackles. He lowers his head and bites my shoulder like a predator.*
> MC: You!
> *Pain spreads like fire. Then, Sylus extends his tongue, slowly licking the wound on my shoulder. It's as if he's claiming and soothing me.*
> Sylus: If you want to push me away, now's the time.
> *His tongue alternates between licking and biting, sending a strange, tingling sensation through my body despite the lingering pain. He slowly licks over my throbbing wound. Sylus tightens his grip again and again. His eyes are filled with fervent excitement and a hunger that knows no end.*
> Sylus: However, if you don't want to...
> *The mark on my shoulder that belongs to him burns. Dizzy, I lift my gaze. My strength is draining away, but I see his wounds slowly healing.*
> MC: ...Sylus, did you already know that we would instinctively want to devour each other?
> Sylus: ... `(Laughs)`
> MC: Then why did you rescue me from the Abyss?
> *I wriggle under him, and he intertwines his fingers with mine. My hands are ensnared.*
> Sylus: And what about you? Why didn't you just kill me earlier?
> *I freeze. In the moonlit silence, Sylus raises his hand and gently touches the area around my eyes. In the darkness, a kiss as gentle as a falling flower lands above my eyes. My limbs tremble, weakened by the torrent of emotions coursing through me. I gaze into his eyes for what feels like an eternity. The murky chaos that was impossible to read is gone. At this moment, I can finally see his eyes clearly.*
> Sylus: "The fiend will meet his destined archnemesis again. At this place." Heh, I'll admit he was correct. I told you before that I'd give you two more chances to kill me. Now, you only have one.
> *In that instant, the turmoil in my heart settles, and I twist my hand to clasp his.*
> MC: You only said a half-truth. I told you before that I'm greedy. I live how I want, and I hate being controlled by others. If fate wants me to kill the Fiend...
> *A warm, soft [[golden light]] spills from my palm. I press it against the wound on Sylus's chest.*
> MC: Then I'll save him instead.
> Sylus: Save me? Are you aware of the cost? Once we hold hands now, our lives will be bound together along with our deaths.
* ((Intertwined hands motif))
> Sylus: We must offer half our soul to the other. They'll be merged... to forge an unbreakable bond. To share your life with a fiend--it might be a punishment worse than having your soul devoured. Will you truly not regret it?
> MC: I said I'll live, didn't I? No matter the cost. If following our hearts is a sin, then you and I must be the last of our kind in this world.
* ((Kindred spirits motif))
> *Moonlight replaces the flickering candlelight. As our hearts beat in unison, he kisses the inside of my wrist with something akin to devotion.*
> Sylus: In that case... Stay by my side until the end of time.
> *In the moonlight, the dragon's tail wraps around me and draws me into his embrace. He spreads one wing to shield us from the cold wind and the sudden midnight rain. That night, I fall into a deep sleep in his warm embrace.*
