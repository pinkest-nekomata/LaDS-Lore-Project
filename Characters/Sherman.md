A former underling of [[Sylus]]'s, he's always been a peacock type (([[WU-10 Mischief]])). When Sylus 'disappeared' between the events of [[WU-10 Mischief]] and [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], Sherman ended up betraying him.

It's strongly implied that [[Ever]] bought him off, and therefore has been behind the [[modified Protocore]]s as well as the acquisition of the [[Aether Core]] at the auction (i.e. MC's Aether Core's other half.)

It's [[Sherman]] that contracts the [[Man in Black]] to bring [[MC]] into the [[N109 Zone]],  and he's likely also working with the [[mysterious Ever representative]] at [[The Nest]].
* ((When [[Luke and Kieran]] refer to cleaning up the nest, it's possible that this is one person they 'took care of', but unclear.))

He gets a chance to plead for his life in [[02-02.08 Undercurrents]], but [[Sylus]] kills him for his betrayal, then cleans house.
