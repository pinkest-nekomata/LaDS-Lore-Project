"Entering the mansion, my surroundings seem to blur. What captures my attention is the fish tank in the center of the hall. There's no water in it. An odd skeleton sits in the center of the tank, and under the light, it appears dull and pale. Fin-like bones protrude from its pelvis. The skeleton lacks legs, its spine extending like a long string. Its pose is ominously beautiful, resembling a girl sitting cross-legged." -- [[01-02.02 Close Encounter]]

A spiral staircase winds around the cylindrical glass tank. ((This is a central place of honor.))

This is confirmed to be a Lemurian skeleton in (citation TBA), where [[Rafayel]] visits during [[Raymond]]'s funeral and offers flowers to the skeleton instead of to him.

When MC first notices it, [[Herman]] tells her it's "just art" and to not overthink it.

Neither the [[Hunter's Watch]] nor MC's [[Evol]] can detect any [[Metaflux]] from it. ((This implies that MC initially thinks the strange anatomy might be because it's [[Wanderer]]-related, but it's not.))
