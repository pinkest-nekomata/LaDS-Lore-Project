> "The 2036 Disaster... If I'm not misaken, it started because of a [[Protocore map]]. Is that where you got your inspiration?"
> [[Phantom Thief Pea]], [[WU-14 Elysium#04 Strawberry Disaster Special]]

A disastrous and drawn-out gang war in the [[N109 Zone]] in late 2036, during which a full third of the N109 Zone's population "vanished".

[[Phantom Thief Pea]] was around for it.

From [[WU-14 Elysium#04 Strawberry Disaster Special]]:
> Late 2036--
> The N109 Zone experienced its largest riot since its conception.
> A scramble for a [[Protocore map]] soon escalated into a gang war. It engulfed every faction.
> The festering, rotting darkness opened like an inflamed abscess. It revealed the true face of this soul-devouring cesspit.
> The fighting raged for months until the weak were fully consumed and every resource was carved up.
> In the end, the N109 Zone's turmoil disappeared, and the legendary [[Sylus]] emerged as the victor.
> The once three-way power balance was shattered, and the lawless territory finally met its new master.
