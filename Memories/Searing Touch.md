**Description**
> While monitoring a smuggling operation, I'm ambushed. Sylus suddenly appears and gets into trouble saving me. I decide to...

# Summary
MC is on a stakeout to intercept smuggled [[Protocore]]s. Sylus hacks into her comms, telling here there are no [[Protocore]]s here. Then, the smugglers suddenly break into gunshots and chaos. Sylus swoops in and saves MC from an explosion and a flashbang, covering her eyes but being blinded himself. MC leads him back to his hotel room nearby, asking when his men will be done so she can check the suitcases she was watching. He says it'll be a bit.

MC complains, but ends up falling asleep on the sofa. She wakes at 6am, then goes to find Sylus. Hearing the water running for a while but getting no response, she goes into the bathroom. She finds him tending to his wounds, and he asks for help getting shrapnel out. She tries to downplay her concern (and her getting flustered at him being shirtless) and he teases her.

Once the sun is up, MC calls in to the Association and agrees to bring in the smuggled items. Sylus can see again and reveals he's been able to "as soon as you were holding the tweezers and looking at my arm with a pained expression". He offers a box as acknowledgement of her help, then invites her to stay for breakfast if she's worried. MC declines, needing to get back to the Association. She tries to catch him out, but he ends up earnestly confessing that he did indeed go there to protect her.

# Key Info
* MC and Sylus are more familiar here, and MC has witnessed some of Sylus's mundane bad luck.
	* She's worried about if his wounds hurt, despite teasing him about getting injured protecting her.
	* She gets flustered seeing him shirtless.
* Sylus says his eyes are several times more sensitive to light than a normal person's.
	* He can see easily in the dark.
	* His other senses, like hearing, are heightened too and he's still aware of what's going on around him even while blinded.
* Sylus's wounds don't heal like they usually do, and he asks for her help getting shrapnel out.
	* Based on what we learn in [[No Way Out]], the bright light has a lasting negative impact on Sylus's ability to heal.
* Despite Sylus's healing abilities, he still has scars from not properly tending to wounds in the past.
* Sylus's comment about "I'd rather risk exposing my weaknesses when I protect you than see you injured" seems to place this after [[Greedy Heart]].
	* This is additionally fitting a MC notes [[Greedy Heart]] as being just when things were getting better between her and Sylus, and her concern in this memoria reflects that turning point as having happened.

# Trivia
* Sylus stayed in a suite with massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a view of all of [[Linkon]].

> *I lean against the wall and keep an eye on the suspicious group of people nearby.*

> MC: Boss-man, I remember your luck never being good in the first place. Your ice cream fell onto the ground when you were about to eat it, there wasn't a seasoning packet for your instant noodles when you opened it... Do I need to keep going?
> Sylus: ... `(Grumbles)`

> Sylus: You sound happy.
> *Taking advantage of Sylus's current obedience, I saunter down the street while holding his sleeve.*

> Sylus: Do you need something?
> MC: I... called out to you earlier, but I didn't hear a response. So I decided to check in on you.

> MC: Sylus, I suggest you cherish. My. Gratitude.

> Sylus: Did I say I was there for it?
> MC: Oh, so it was because of me.

> Sylus: Yeah, you're right. I went there for you.
> *I'm speechless at his honesty.*
> *Sylus narrows his eyes and pulls me back so l'm right in front of him.*
> Sylus: I knew there was going to be an ambush. You weren't even aware of it, sweetie. And I was so worried that I couldn't let other people deal with it... I'd rather risk exposing my weaknesses when I protect you than see you injured. Is that what you wanted to hear?
> *I listen to him say each word. When Sylus stops speaking, I raise my chin. I'm intrigued.*
> MC: Yup. How did you know?
> *Sylus points to his eyes, and then he solemnly points to my heart.*
> Sylus: It's because of the infrared detector. Probably.
