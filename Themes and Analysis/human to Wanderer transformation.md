# Transformation
[[Never-Ending Winter#05 A Long Way Home]] and [[Never-Ending Winter#06 The Nightmare Worsens]] describe [[William]]'s transformation in detail:
> "What is it?" William turns around.
> Unable to speak, Zayne points.
> Confused, William looks down.
> An eerie blue glow appears on his chest. Crystals, beautiful and sinister, slowly begin to spread. [...]
> "What is this?"
> Suspicious, [[William]] touches them. He finds the fine [[black crystals]] are now growing on his hand and sting. He tries to wipe them off, fling them off, even use his [[Evol]] to get rid of them. The crystals continue to grow. [...]
> It all happens so suddenly.
> The crystals accumulate, and Wiliam's expression goes from surprised to panicked. "W-what's going on?!"
> But the crystals don't give him any time to react. Within seconds, his limbs corrode, twisting into uncomfortable, strange positions. The air around him explodes. [...] His bones and muscles are torn and start to dissolve. he cries out in pain.
> [...] The crystals, consuming bone, devouring marrow, climb to his neck. HIs arms, moving on their own, attack [[Zayne]]. William watches with dread as his body becomes twisted and gnarled.
> "It's already too late... Kill me!"
> [...] The tissue underneath the crystals rapidly forms a strange shell. [...] Crystals have encased William's body, leaving only his eyes, which stare at Zayne with a mix of pain and hope.
