A key theme in [[Where Stars Scatter]].

Each month, the [[Order of Babel]] monastery holds a [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] to select [[revenant]]s to travel the [[Sinders]], and it's believed they'll find the [[Tree of Life]] that connects [[Sindersfell]] to [[Philos]].

This is a tragic parody of the "Pilgrimage" started on [[Philos]] by the royal family as a cover for "feeding" humans to the planet's core to sustain it. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 7]]) See also [[Tree of Life]].
