[[Xavier]]'s [[Evol]] power is limited by a neck suppression collar. He first got this collar in [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], after defying his controlling family in an effort to help [[Academy MC]].

The [[Hunters Association]] was able to at least increase the threshold, but [[Xavier]]'s full power level is still limited.

[[03-C Voyage of the Outcast - 10]] hints that MC's power, especially with the [[Aether Core]], can temporarily override this limit.

In [[Feverish Attempts]], it's revealed that over-use of his Evol can also trigger a fever due to the [[suppression collar]].

# Additional Quotes
From [[WU-07 With Light#04 Has the Light Vanished?]]:
> "...Light Evol has been detected. Evolver's Evol limit cannot be defined."
> "Any attempts to probe its limit triggers a special neck suppressor, which prevents the Evolver from using their full power."
> "The techies can't explain it. No physical form detected, no scars, and the energy suppression field acts like a [[Protofield]] anomaly."
> "After conducting a series of experiments in the lab, the techies finally unraveled the suppressor's mechanism. They boosted its threshold and got a basic understanding of some of its mechanisms."
> Below the text is a close-up of someone's throat, the Evol suppressor pulsating as a vicious, constrictive red ring of light.
