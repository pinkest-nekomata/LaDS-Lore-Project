# Summary
Finally willing to try to work with [[Sylus]], [[MC]] emerges from the [[Odd Workshop]] and can't find him. She runs into a [[Little Girl]], who offers to sell her flowers (or bullets or [[Protocores]]). MC asks for information, so the girl takes her to [[Elysium]]. MC tries to buy data on the auction, but finds it's a hot commodity and she lacks the funds.

While she's still eavesdropping, [[Wire Jaw]] arrives with a search party to look for her. She hides with the [[Little Girl]] and the help of the [[Shopkeeper]], and just as she tries to make a break for the exit, [[Sylus]] arrives. He deals with the thugs, though allows [[Wire Jaw]]  to panic and summon [[Wanderer]]s before fleeing. Sylus leaves MC to fend for herself for fives minutes while he lets [[Wire Jaw]] lead him to a nearby [[Flux Nexus]] that is the source of the disturbance.

Meanwhile, [[Mephisto]] helps [[MC]] fight [[human-like Wanderer]]s, which only fall when the [[Flux Nexus]] is destroyed. Back at [[Sylus's base]], MC has to pass one more test before [[Sylus]] will take her to the [[Protocore auction]]--she needs to steal his brooch. (These are the events of [[Midnight Stealth]]).

After barely passing the test, MC heads with Sylus to the [[Solon Hotel]] and the [[Protocore auction]]. She serves as a distraction on the auction floor while Sylus, who many had presumed dead, goes to meet with [[Sherman]]. Sherman tries and fails to make an appeal for his life, and Sylus confirms that [[Ever]] bought [[Sherman]] out in the most boring way possible. (Ever isn't specifically mentioned, but all clues point in this direction--or a highly related faction.)

That taken care of and the location of the [[Aether Core]] confirmed, [[Sylus]] uses that intel to "buy" a dance from [[MC]]. Before long, he triggers the explosions meant to trap him with a detonator presumably snatched from [[Sherman]]. In the chaos, they head to the roof of the building, which used to be an [[Ever]] Group research lab. It's right below the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], and the [[Aether Core]] is in a [[Flux Nexus]]--summoning an immensely powerful [[Wanderer]] that [[Sherman]]'s faction of [[Onychinus]] was sure could stop even [[Sylus]].

The [[Wanderer]] is an [[Arbiterwings]], the same type that circled [[Sorceress MC]] as she received her judgement of lightning (see also [[Heavenly Tribulation]]) in [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]]. She and Sylus defeat it without resonating, then are knocked from its [[Protofield]].

She has a longer flashback to his sword in her chest before he reaches out to her and tells her to press on. She takes his hand, and they resonate, allowing her power to flow again and she takes in the other half of the [[Aether Core]]. Afterward, the linkage lingers between them, forcing [[MC]] to return to [[Sylus's base]]. Meanwhile, all the traitors in the [[N109 Zone]] are wiped out.

MC and Sylus discuss next steps--she still owes him more resonance sessions until the problems are fixed. She leaves the zone without issue, but begins to remember fragments of her time on [[Philos]].

## Commentary

### Aether Core Half
[[Philip]] seems to be the first to refer to the [[Aether Core]] in [[Sherman]]'s possession as MC's [[Aether Core]]'s other half, and [[Sylus]] seems well-acquainted with this also. It's unclear whether MC picks it up from them or already suspected. Notably, [[Josephine's secret notes]] indicate that MC's power values were half their prior peak levels when MC was recovered from the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], which corresponds to the other half of the power being taken and put into a vessel.

### Sylus's Aether Core
MC calls Sylus's power an Aether Core and he pretty much says "sure let's go with that", indicating that it's not an entirely accurate description of his power. [[Beyond Cloudfall]] seems to establish that Sylus was born with the power in his eye, vs MC's [[Aether Core]] which is more of a 'cultivator core' (see [[Cores in Xianxia]]).
