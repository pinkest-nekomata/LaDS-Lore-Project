# Anecdote
Relevant LI: [[Xavier]]
Main POV character: [[Academy MC]]
Associated Companion: [[Xavier - Distant Youth]]

The tragic story of [[Xavier]]'s first meeting with MC's soul unfolds at the [[Academy]] in future-[[Philos]].

## Summary
This story is set in future-[[Philos]], on the Plate with the [[Academy]]. [[Academy MC]] is a student with the [[Resonance Evol]] and [[Protocore Syndrome]], which is a terminal diagnosis. She hides this from her crush, the mysterious [[Xavier]], who is constantly surrounded by bodyguards. They first meant in the year 214--which means it had been 214 years since Earth died and was reborn as [[Philos]], a planet of fragmented Plates separated by the vacuum of space and held together by the planet's powerful artificial core.

[[Xavier]] and [[Academy MC]] work around the interruptions of [[Xavier]]'s bodyguards to slowly get to know each other better. [[Academy MC]] asks him to see a meteor shower with him, knowing she won't live long enough to see the next one. He agrees, but before they can go, MC faints and is forced to tell him about her heart condition.

They go see the shower together. MC wishes to be healthy. [[Xavier]] wishes to hug her--and his wish is soon granted. She gives him the [[star tassel]], which he will treasure for a long, long time. But after that night, he vanishes.

Within a month, MC is admitted to the hospital permanently, with only a few days left to live. On intuition, and not wanting to die in the hospital, she sneaks back out to the [[Skymirror Salt Flat]] where they'd watched the meteor shower. She's just in time to find a bloodied [[Xavier]] who's now sporting a [[suppression collar]]. He's found the [[Protocore]] that will heal her--but it's too late. She asks him to sit with her.

There are no stars out that night, so [[Xavier]] uses his [[Evol]] to summon one for her. They exchange heartfelt words about meeting in her next life, and [[Academy MC]] dies in his arms.

## Commentary

### Xavier is *actually* a youth
Though [[Xavier]]'s age is not explicitly stated, given that the Companion title is "Distant Youth", it seems this story is meant to describe when he's *actually* young. So, [[Academy MC]] is his first love, which explains why his devotion is so lasting.

### Philos's Origin & 214 Years
This is the clearest description we get of the origin and geography of [[Philos]] (see that page for more info). Note that [[Xavier]] and [[MC]] first meet 214 years *after* the fall of earth. In [[Xavier's Trailer]], he mentions that it's his 214th spring on Earth, and his last. (This is corroborated by [[WU-04 From The Stars]] saying they've been on earth over 200 years.) For more discussion on this significance, refer to [[Traceback II]].

### MC's Heart
MC's terminal heart condition is called [[Protocore Syndrome]] here, and it can only be cured with a special Protocore that can heal all illnesses. This is echoed by the [[Gardener MC]]'s condition in [[Tower of Secrets]], [[Zayne]]'s myth. However, unlike [[Zayne]], [[Xavier]] isn't able to save her. See also [[MC's heart]].

### Star Tassel
This is the origin of the [[star tassel]], which [[Queen MC]] will ironically be jealous of in [[Shooting Stars]]. We already see here [[Xavier]]'s unwillingness to communicate, which ends up affecting that life as well--he lets her be jealous of herself, instead of assuring her. Here, he disappears to find the [[Protocore]], when she really would have rather spent the month with him.

# 01 Distant Stars
[[Academy MC]] gets caught sneaking a glance at [[Xavier]] in the class they have together. She hopes he was staring back at her.

Three years prior, [[Xavier]] had first arrived at the [[Academy]].
> It was the year 214. Two hundred and fourteen years have passed since Philos's birth. It also means 214 years have passed since Earth's demise.
> Our teachers, born during the Age of Earth, said we had substituted Earth's extinguished core with a powerful, artificial one. This core holds fragmented landmasses together, preventing them from scattering into the starry sea.
> So aside from more dust, more cloudy days, and cumbersome travel between tectonic plates, our planet isn't much different from the Earth of years past.
> My feet have never touched the soil of other places on [[Philos]]. Our Plate where the [[Academy]] is located is quite small. Also, unlike us, who were brought here after our [[Evol]] awakened, Xavier was a transfer student.

MC vividly remembers being enchanted by him during that first meeting, and since then, they've barely talked. He's surrounded by bodyguards and mysterious rumors. He's a talented swordsman and top of the class despite never paying attention. He dozes off in class. [[Academy MC]] has tried to use her [[Resonance Evol]] to resonate with his dreams, but she chickened out, finally realizing she has a crush.

She expects things to stay that way, then hears that a once-in-a-century meteor shower is happening the next month. It's soon revealed that [[Academy MC]] won't live to see the next one, due to her heart condition, so this gives her the courage to ask [[Xavier]] to see it with her.
> *If I can see it with someone I like, then I can die without regrets.*

# 02 Gravity
[[Academy MC]] watches [[Xavier]] train, working up the courage to ask him. She notes that rare events aren't special to people like him.

> People like Xavier, they'll experience many centuries. As long as Philos's core still has energy, their lives shall last forevermore like the planet's.
> If he learns I'm a person who can't even live to see 100 years, he'll do anything I say out of pity. That would ruin everything.

After class, [[Academy MC]] sees [[Xavier]]'s bodyguards for herself. He seems upset, so she calls out to him--then realizing it's probably the first time she's ever done so. He's puzzled, then happy to see her. She tells him a teacher wants to see him, then pulls him away from the bodyguards.

Xavier notices they're catching up, so he pulls her into an empty auditorium. They sit together, and he asks why she helped him. He asks how she knew he was upset, then teases her for sneaking glances during class. She says there's a reason--and then has to scramble for one. SO, she invites him to the meteor shower at [[Skymirror Salt Flat]].

Xavier thinks, then regretfully says he can't go. She correctly guesses it's because of "those people". Not wanting him to be sad, she says she'll go herself and bring his wish to the stars. He say she doesn't have a wish. So, she takes this as a prompt to make up one for him--that Xavier is forever free to do what he wants.

He's stunned, and asks her wish. She wishes to be healthy, closing her eyes to pretend to wish on a star. When she opens them, Xavier summons a light and says:
> "This shooting star has made a promise to you."

# 03 Collision
Despite a clear forecast, it's raining. Stuck in a botany class, [[Academy MC]] passes notes to [[Xavier]]. They've been stealing these subtle little moments together since that day in the auditorium. A teacher catches her with the note, and assigns her to clean-up duty after class.

[[Xavier]] stays to tell her he has an umbrella. Since his bodyguards are watching, he pulls all the light from the room to darken it so they can't see. They quickly clean together, then leave and share his umbrella. She's hungry, so they dodge Xavier's guards again and go get food together.

She asks to see his wooden sword, then wonders why he likes training so much. He says he doesn't like it, it's just the only thing he's been good at since he was a child. Then he changes the subject to the meteor shower, but the hope is short lived--his guards have caught up to them. He thinks about resisting, then gives in, leaving her with the umbrella and walking away with the men.

> Later, I asked Xavier what would happen if he didn't leave that night. He thinks about it, and then says to reach for freedom is to give it up.
> It took me a long time to understand what he meant.
> *If wishing on a star does make your wish come true, then I wish I could be healthy. Then I can wait another hundred years to watch the meteor shower with Xavier.*

# 04 Friction
Before the meteor shower, [[Academy MC]] faints in class. [[Xavier]] is perturbed to learn she's been hiding her heart condition from him. She stumbles through an explanation that it's a birth defect. He looks at her medicine bottle.
> "What's [[Protocore Syndrome]]?"
> "It's probably... a terminal illness that makes my heart weaker and weaker?"
> "Is there no cure?"
> "There is... but we need a special [[Protocore]]."
> "What kind?"
> "They say there's a Protocore that can cure any illness..."
* Note that MC's heart condition and its cure is very similar in [[Zayne]]'s permanent myth, [[Tower of Secrets]].
* [[Protocore Syndrome]] is also her diagnosis in the main story timeline.

[[Academy MC]] tries to put [[Xavier]] at ease, but wheels are clearly turning in his mind. He commits to watching the meteor shower together.

# 05 Incineration
It's late autumn and MC can't sleep. Finally, she takes the bumpy train ride to [[Skymirror Salt Flat]]. Her walk turns into a run, and she sees [[Xavier]] in the middle of the lake, not wearing his uniform. She steps into the shallow water, and he turns and takes her hand, leading her to the trestle bridge.
* ((Bridges are a common theme in romance, often symbolizing important moments in a relationship, or the connection between two people.))

Sitting on the bridge, [[Xavier]] assures her that his bodyguards aren't there. Then the meteor shower begins, and they watch the spectacle together, making their wishes.
> We sit there, between heaven and earth, until the sky turns lilac.

As they go to leave, MC gives him a gift: the [[star tassel]]. He asks her to help him put it on his sword.

She tries to drag him back the way they came, but he stops moving, then somewhat awkwardly asks to hug her.
> "What?" Thinking I misheard him, I look into his eyes for confirmation.
> "Can I hug you?" He repeats himself. His tone is soft, fluttering to my ears like the wind.
> Before I can react, he takes a few steps closer and leans down to hug me, all in one motion executed with calm precision. I'm stunned. Then, my hands slowly climb up his back.
> So, this is what it feels like to hug him.
> "Thank you. My wish came true," he whispers into my ear. "Next time there's a meteor shower, let's visit this place again."
> I nod.
> I wish time stopped at this moment, and I hope my wish can come true.
> But was this the price I had to pay for my selfishness?
> *Ever since that night, which was the brightest point of my life, everything became fleeting, fading like a shooting star.*

# 06 Stardust Trail
Her condition deteriorates rapidly after the meteor shower. She's hospitalized more frequently until she finally can't leave anymore. That was expected--the surprise was that after the meteor shower, [[Xavier]] disappeared without a trace.

MC remembers what he'd said about freedom--did he lose it when he went to watch the meteor shower with her? She's restless in the hospital, and knows her days are numbered. So, she decides to sneak out and go back out to the salt flat, based on a feeling he'll be there.

A month ago, she was healthy enough to run and jump. Now, she's just happy to hear the salt under her feet. She sits on the bridge for hours, watching the sky and its reflection, knowing this will be the last time she ever sees it.

Then she sees [[Xavier]]--and he's running for her. He's wounded, desperate, and shows her a small, glowing [[Protocore]]. She notices the red glow of the [[suppression collar]], which is new. She asks, "Did you exchange your freedom for this?"

He says it's the [[Protocore]] that will heal her, but it's too late--her weakening heart was only holding on to see him one more time, and now she has. She asks him to sit beside her and talk to her. He lets the Protocore fall and does as she asked.

> "If I wasn't sick, would you watch the stars with me?"
> "Yes." Xaier puts an arm around me, letting me lean on his shoulder. "Not just the stars. I'll show you the mountains and rivers, the sun and the moon. We'll see them together. [...] No matter what happens, I'll be by your side. And no matter how long you rest, I'll wait for you."

She's getting weaker, and says it's a shame there's no stars out tonight. "There's one," he says, summoning a ball of light just for her.
> "I wish to meet you in my next life... I wonder if that will come true..."
> "... It will."

Finally, MC can't open her eyes anymore. She begins to slip away. The last thing she hears is Xavier saying:
> "No matter how many times it takes, no matter where you are... I will find you."
