# General Info

#todo since I saw a note about 108 being a significant number in Sylus's [[Beyond Cloudfall]] myth and the [[N109 Zone]], I'm noting that there's also a concept of 108 heroes or stars of destiny in chinese fiction ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/108_Heroes))

# Sincerity
A minor recurring theme, mentioned here and there including in [[Land of Lost]] and [[Grassland Romance]].
