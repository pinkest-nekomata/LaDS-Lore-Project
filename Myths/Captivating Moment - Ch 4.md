# Summary
After dinner, [[MC]] finds [[Sylus]] in a music room in the suite. The walls are lined with expensive instruments and records, mostly classical. He relaxes with a glass of red wine, looking out over the [[N109 Zone]] while he listens to music. [[Mephisto]] tosses him a coin which he skillfully rolls across his fingers.

This is another puzzle piece for MC. She notes how he under-plays things, seeming uninterested in showing off. He buys the things he likes, not things to show off for status.

Luke arrives with news that [[Kovi]] wants to play cards--and [[MC]] jumps on this as a chance to prove herself.

## Commentary

### Sylus isn't a show-off
Sylus doesn't really flaunt his wealth and power. He describes his extensive collection of antique instruments and records as just "buying the things I like".

# Details

After dinner, Sylus disappears again. Worried he might leave without her, MC seeks him out, following the sound of classical music. ((The song that plays is the [[requiem]] from [[Continuous Symphony]] and [[Beyond Cloudfall]].))

> What greets me is a wall covered in records and all sorts of exquisite musical instruments.
> Sylus sits on the sofa facing the full-length windows. He gazes outside into the night, and his leg rests on the coffee table. He holds a glass of red wine in one hand and appears very relaxed.
> MC: I thought you'd do something dangerous after having a nice meal.
> Sylus: I'm not interested in getting appendicitis.
> *Mephisto, who's perched by the window, lets out a caw. It's almost like he's mocking me.*
> *I turn to glare at him. Then, whether it's shame or simply wanting to ignore me, Mephisto picks up a coin and flips it onto Sylus's shoulder.*
> *Sylus takes the coin and skillfully rolls it across his knuckles.*
> MC: Are these musical instruments yours?
> Sylus: They're part of an antique collection.
> *I walk around the room. Almost all the records on the wall are for classical music.*
> *Meanwhile, the instruments are well-maintained as they exude a faint luster.*
> MC: Not only do you have an armory, but you could also open a record or music store.
> Sylus: Just so happens I can buy the things I like.
> *It seems I've gotten used to Sylus downplaying things. He's always calm, honest, and not interested in showing off.*
> Sylus: If you're bored, there are a lot of things downstairs that can help kill time.
> *I shake my head and sit down on the other side of the sofa.*
> MC:  I'm not. To be honest, it feels like I'm putting together a jigsaw puzzle.
> *Sylus sets down his glass. He moves his neck and runs a hand through his hair.*
> Sylus: You have a lot more puzzle pieces to collect. I guess.
> MC: I just found a new piece.
> *I point to Sylus's neck, which he has tilted back.*
> MC: I've noticed that when you're sitting by yourself, you often move your head back. Is your neck stiff?
> Sylus: ... Do hunters also need to play doctor?
> *Sylus suddenly reaches out and lowers my head.*
> MC: ...What are you doing?
> Sylus: If you keep your head down like this for an hour, you'll understand.
> MC: ...Is it because you're constantly looking down at people?
> *Sylus shrugs. He starts playing with the coin again.*
> MC: (It seems everything's not all fine and dandy for someone this tall...)
> *For some reason, this small detail makes me feel as if Sylus isn't so far away.*

Luke ([[Luke and Kieran]]) arrives to say that [[Kovi]] called, asking when Sylus will play cards. MC asks to tag along. Sylus points out that it's not a regular game of cards, and she replies that it's therefore a perfect chance for her to prove herself.
