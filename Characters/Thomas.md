## Backstory
[[A Unique Vermillion#03 Passionate Colors]] reveals that [[Thomas]] used to be an artist himself. While he was competent technically, his paintings were missing that *je ne sais qoui* compared to Rafayel's--it's [[Rafayel]]'s custom pigments that give him the edge and make his paintings truly one-of-a-kind. Though they met as fellow artists at an exhibition, Thomas ends up going to business school just so he can be Rafayel's agent and bring those colors to more people.
