# Summary
After [[MC]] tests some weapon upgrades from [[Simone]], she and [[Xavier]] meet and discuss the mission over coffee. [[MC]] has a hunch that [[Xavier]]'s secrets and prior knowledge of her [[Aether Core]] mean he probably has some leads about this one. They briefly discuss and he nudges her into asking directly, then gives a vague answer about how the [[Aether Core]]s get their power from "the very core of the cosmos" and therefore it's critical that they aren't all awakened.

As they finish their conversation, [[Andrew]] calls with an update. They can now pursue a suspicious [[Wanderer]] with a [[Beta-Protocurve]] that MC had previously identified.

## Commentary
Though [[MC]] only has a hunch at this point, [[Xavier]] has probably the most complete understanding of the [[Aether Core]]s of all the LIs due to his coming from [[Philos]] and being part of the [[Traceback II]] mission.

# Details

[[MC]] and [[Andrew]] are tracking a suspicious [[Wanderer]], and while [[MC]] waits for an update, she tries out new gear that [[Simone]] modified for her. [[Xavier]] is late as usual, and arrives as MC finishes.

He claims his tardiness is due to a new lead, and invites her to the break room to discuss it over coffee. Apparently, some smugglers were painting [[Protocore fragment]]s and hiding them with coffee beans--but all they found were [[modified Protocore]]s, no signs of the [[Aether Core]] fragments.

MC is surprised he doesn't know about the [[Aether Core]] fragments given all his secrets, but she doesn't press the issue. Xavier picks up on this, and seems disappointed that she isn't--so she bites and asks directly.

He indicates that he knows there are multiple [[Aether Core]]s, but not how many.
> Xavier: Their power comes from the very core of the cosmos. If fully awakened, they would spell disaster for the world.
> [...]
> Xavier: I know, you're not satisfied with my answer. But there are some truths you have to see and decide for yourself.

Their watches beep as [[Andrew]] calls in with an update on the suspicious [[Wanderer]]--they have a lead to chase.
