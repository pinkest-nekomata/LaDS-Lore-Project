# Details
More [[Foulwings]] keep showing up. [[Xavier]] teleports himself and MC away to safety.

MC determines that the [[Foulwings]] attacked due to the [[modified Protocore]] from the [[Flux Nexus]].

Xavier examines the protocore and determines that it's clearly the work of [[Onychinus]], then gives it back. He tells her to let the [[Hunters Association]] handle it. He leaves, saying that the moon is much brighter now and she won't get lost. (Also, the energy fluctuations have been dealt with.)

The camera pulls back, revealing a mechanical crow ([[Mephisto]]) watching from the trees.
 * ((This indicates that [[Sylus]] was aware of MC's whereabouts and her ability to resonate with the [[Flux Nexus]]. Later, we learn that the [[modified Protocore]] was the work of [[Professor Lucius]] ([[04-02.10 Crossroads]]) not [[Sylus]]. At this point, [[Sylus]] hasn't officially returned to [[Onychinus]], but is keeping an eye on things.))
