The lore and events in LaDS can get quite complex, especially as the writers gradually reveal schemes over time. This page aims to summarize the "bad guys" of the story and what they've been up to. This will include spoilers and things not revealed until many chapters later, for the sake of clarity.

All roads lead back to EVER.

# Under Deepspace
In the story's initial arc, these are the key events:
* [[Ever]] acquires [[Raymond]]'s company [[Xander Sciences]]
	* [[Carter]], Zayne's former research colleague, is working on project [[X-Heart]] at [[Xander Sciences]]. That project will eventually become [[The Fountain of Atei]] (and [[Professor Lucius]] will at some point take on leadership of this project).
* Traitor [[Backtrackers]], backed by [[Ever]], set traps for [[Xavier]] in an effort to get him out of the picture and stop him from interfering. (See also [[traps for Xavier]].)
	* In return, [[Xavier]] takes bounties to kill these [[Backtrackers]] ([[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]])
* Under the guidance of [[Professor Lucius]], [[Ever]] takes out a hit on [[Grandma]] (Josephine) and "recovers" [[Caleb]] in the process, all to get information on [[MC]].
	* The assassin is [[duckbill cap man]]
	* [[Caleb]]'s fate is detailed in [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]]--[[Professor Lucius]] implants a [[Toring chip]], installs [[Caleb's mechanical arm]], and turns him into a pawn he can use to control the [[Farspace Fleet]].
* At some point, when [[Sylus]] leaves the [[N109 Zone]], [[Sherman]] takes over. [[Ever]] buys him out.
	* [[Sherman]]'s branch of [[Onychinus]] works on [[modified Protocore]]s, including attempting to resurrect the [[Aeonwyrm]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]
	* They orchestrate the [[Protocore auction]] as a trap for [[Sylus]], trying to take him out of the picture once and for all. Especially since [[Sylus]] has been causing problems for them since the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].

# Long Awaited Revelry
* [[MC]] overhears someone telling [[Sylus]] about [[The Fountain of Atei]].
* [[Sherman]]'s lackey, [[Wire Jaw]], summons the [[human-like Wanderer]]s created as a byproduct of  [[The Fountain of Atei]] to use as weapons against MC when trying to kidnap [[MC]]. 
	* She takes a crystal sample from them and later analyzes it with [[Zayne]], who confirms that the [[human-like Wanderer]]s were intentionally created.
* [[Sherman]] (backed by [[Ever]]) attempts to go through with the trap for [[Sylus]], using the half of the [[Aether Core]] to summon an [[Arbiterwings]] with the [[Flux Nexus]] on the roof of the [[Solon Hotel]] just below the [[Deepspace Tunnel]].
	* Later, it's revealed that [[Professor Lucius]]'s "family" were actually the ones who learned how to use the [[Flux Nexus]]es.

# Prologue to Tomorrow
* [[Ever]] deploys a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] to attract and manipulate [[Wanderer]]s, then unveils to the public a device with the opposite function--a portable [[Flux Stablizer]] meant to prevent [[Wanderer]]s from appearing.
	* Note how they have both the disease and cure--a way to create [[Wanderer]] incidents to frighten people, then something to sell to soothe their fear.

# Homecoming Wings
* [[Professor Lucius]] has been turning the [[Farspace Fleet]] into a tool he can use for his and [[Ever]]'s purposes. They're installing the [[Toring chip]] into the Fleet to turn them into tools, he's attempting to fashion [[Caleb]] into a living weapon, and they have their sights set on something (not yet revealed) in [[Deepspace]].
	* [[Kevi and Mia's parents]] ended up with a fragment of the [[Spatium Core]] and gave it to [[Kevi]] in hopes he could escape the Fleet's influence. Unfortunately, [[Professor Lucius]] ended up with both [[Kevi]] and the [[Spatium Core]] fragment.
* It's also revealed that [[Professor Lucius]] is collecting a "family" of operatives including [[Caleb]], [[Viper]], [[Kevi]], and [[black dress girl]].
	* Lucius takes credit for running [[The Fountain of Atei]], promising [[bedridden man]] that it will launch soon.
