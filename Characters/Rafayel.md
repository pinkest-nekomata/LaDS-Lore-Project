* #todo If we can figure out how long Rafayel has been back in Linkon, we can determine the season. The records say he returned "Not too long ago"

> "Industry insiders say Rafayel locks himself in his studio for half the year, then spends the rest of his time traveling the world for inspiration. As for his paintings... Just last month, his art broke the record for highest selling price at [[Lizio Auctions]]!"

# Relationship Timeline

They meet as children on the shore of [[Hat Island]], but this is forgotten due to [[MC's memory problems]]. Thus establishing the [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]].

MC first meets him as an adult in [[01-01.07 Ripples]].

Then a day later in [[01-02 The First Mission]], she investigates the painting of his that [[Raymond]] bought, and visits his studio.

Based on their conversation in [[01-07.04 Under The Waves]], she'd forgotten about their bodyguard arrangement at this point. This implies that in the main story timeline, any memories in which Rafayel refers to their bodyguard arrangement would be after [[01-07.04 Under The Waves]], and so also over 6mo after [[Grandma]]'s death. Alternatively, she may have forgotten multiple times.

# Childhood
WIP -- more details to incorporate.
* [[Rafayel]] mentions elements of his [[Lemurian]] childhood in several memories
	* He remembers a [[Seamoon Ceremony]] with his Mother, but this could have happened after Lemuria fell. By the main story, his parents are both dead, which seems inconsistent with him actually being born ~25 years ago
* [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]] seems to clearly indicate they were both children at the time
* [[Lemuria]] was in ruins at this point--so it seems the only way he could have childhood memories of living underwater with [[Lemurian]]s is from his original childhood as the [[Sea God]].
* In [[Sea of Golden Sand]], [[Rafayel]] also overlaps with [[MC]] during childhood, meaning he was "reborn" then too.
* Lemurians are immortal due to their blood.
* Rafayel ends up losing the "heart of the sea god" (he gives it to MC) in [[Forgotten Sea]]--could this affect his immortality?

# Trivia
* Despite being a [[Lemuria]], [[Rafayel]] easily gets seasick ([[01-07.05 Set Sail]]) and motion sick ([[Intertidal Zone]]).
* Like a true fishie, he's afraid of cats. ([[01-07.08 Weak Fiends]])
