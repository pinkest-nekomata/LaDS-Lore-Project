[[05-02 All From Deepspace]] reveals another of [[MC]] and [[Sylus]]'s shared lives--this time as gladiators at an interstellar arena.

Here, they fight [[Wanderer]]s and what appear to be modified humans. They form a team despite [[Sylus]] stealing [[MC]]'s points, because nobody else can keep up with her. When they're the only two left, the crowd cheers for one to kill the other. (Compare to the fate they defy in [[Beyond Cloudfall]] and see [[#Destined arch-nemesis]] below.)

Instead, they make an escape attempt, entering a chaotic nebula that MC compares to an abyss. Sylus implies it was successful, since they're both in Linkon, but given the death and rebirth theme it's likely that they died together and then were separated as they were "reborn".

MC refers to the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] separating them, and the way her memories are presented draws a line between their escape, the tunnel separating them, and an older Sylus appearing to free her from the [[Deepspace Collision Chamber]] during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].

# Theories
## Abysm Soverign's Childhood
[[Sylus - Abysm Sovereign]] originally thought he was a normal person until he started growing dragon horns. [[Beyond Cloudfall]] doesn't contain any clues as to how dragons could have ended up with a seemingly human child.

MC manifesting as a child, plus her specific note that the nebula they jump into is like an abyss draws attention to the possibility that Sylus similarly manifested as a child in the abyss near [[Tarus]] City and the valley of dragons, who took him in and raised him.

This is a compelling theory as it's quite tidy and follows the themes of the story closely.

## Destined arch-nemesis
One thing never explained in [[Beyond Cloudfall]] is *why* MC covets [[Sylus]]'s power and wants to kill him. They're referred to as destined arch-nemeses. While this could all just be thematic framing, the interstellar arena provides a compelling explanation. If you take the interstellar arena to occur before\* [[Beyond Cloudfall]], by becoming the last two standing, this creates their fate as destined arch-nemeses, with one bound to kill the other. It's also the first time they defy that fate.

\*given the cyclical themes that repeat throughout the game's lore, the different myths there's not really meant to be a one-directional linear story, so the arch-nemesis doesn't need a clear "start", but this is still an interesting way to think about it.

## More to come
Just as Sylus's writing team foreshadowed [[Beyond Cloudfall]] (released Dec 2024) in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]] (released July 2024) they are potentially foreshadowing his upcoming myth (to be released in Dec 2025) within [[05 Death and Rebirth]] (released may 2025).

The storytelling leaves open the ages of MC and Sylus when they make their escape attempt, so it's plausible that their next myth will be set in this interstellar arena as young adults.

From [[05-02.05 Rules Fall Before Us]]:
MC: I wanted to ask you something ever since I woke up. But you kept steering the conversation in another direction.
> Sylus: Hmm?
> MC: I "saw" us fighting [[Wanderer]]s in some kind of [[interstellar arena]]. Do you know anything about that
> Sylus: ...What else did you see?
> *My gaze drifts from my hands to his shoulder and then to the light-reflected from the wine-dancing on the wall. I continue in a softer voice.*
> MC: We fought countless [[Wanderer]]s and monsters that looked like modified humans. Then we were the only ones left in the arena... The crowd went wild and screamed for us to fight each other to the death. It doesn't matter where you are in the cosmos. Every gladiatorial arena created by intelligent life abides by the same rule: There can only be one victor. So...
> Sylus: Either I kill you, or you kill me.
> *I sit up straight and touch the corner of his eye. I'm searching for that hidden color in his right eye.*
> MC: But when we faced each other, you didn't attack. Instead, you took my hand and asked if I wanted to escape together. That nebula was more chaotic than an abyss. I didn't see how it ended...
* ((Note the reference to an abyss, in keeping with the themes of [[Sylus - Abysm Sovereign]]))
> MC: Did we manage to escape?
> Sylus: What do you think?
> *He brings his empty wine glass closer and presses its cool surface against my forehead.*
> Sylus: If we hadn't, then who exactly are you looking at right now?
> MC: We're pretty special, huh.
> Sylus: Speaking of which, you never doubted yourself. Or worried about my capabilities for that matter.
> MC: Then you went through hell and back, barely escaped with your life, and arrived in the [[N109 Zone]] before it fell?
> Sylus: More or less. Have you ever considered that me landing in the N109 Zone wasn't a coincidence?
