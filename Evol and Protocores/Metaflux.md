[[MC]] is able to sense and follow [[Metaflux]] [[fluctuation]]s generated by [[Wanderer]]s, [[Protocore]]s, and other related sources. The energy's origins are from Deepspace ([[Hunter Trivia - Protofields]]).

Notably, [[Wanderer]]s are made of [[Metaflux]] and may leave the shimmering blue substance behind. [[Metaflux]] can accumulate in tissues, requiring [[Metaflux]] ablation to remove it. The [[Aeonwyrm]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] was being resurrected by accumulating [[Metaflux]] onto its skeleton through the use of a [[Flux Nexus]]. [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] prevented this from being successful.
