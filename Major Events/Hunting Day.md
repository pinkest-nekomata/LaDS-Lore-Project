> -- Radio, [[01-08.10 Trap]]

An invitation-only event that occurs at [[The Nest]]. It's well-attended by various powerful and illicit individuals and groups.

In [[01-08.01 Bonfire]], the invitation that [[Rafayel]] gives [[MC]] states that the next [[Hunting Day]] will be "The 3rd Sunday of this Month". ((There's no indication in dialogue of how soon/far away it is. It could be anywhere from a few days away to nearly 3 weeks away.))
