"Raising his hand, specks of starlight gradually gather around us. The light moves along his fingers, transforming into golden threads in the dark. A pattern composed of several diamonds appears. Surrounded by radiant light, Xavier quietly stares at me, waiting for me to speak. [...] The light flickers. Maybe Xavier was hoping to hear something else." -- [[01-03.04 Maze]]

[[Xavier]] presents this to [[MC]] in [[01-03.04 Maze]], asking if it looks familiar. MC reports that it does not. He informs her she'll see it on the [[Flux Nexus]].

Conjecture:
 * This symbol appears on the [[Flux Nexus]]es, and is related to [[Philos]] via the similar circular design in Philosian [[Protofield]]s. ([[Hunter Trivia - Protofields]])
 * This is a pattern or symbol from their shared past, and Xavier has recognized MC by this point and is trying to see how much she remembers.
