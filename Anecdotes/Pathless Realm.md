Main POV character: [[Patrick]], [[Timothy]], [[Caleb]]
Associated Companion: [[Caleb - Deepspace Pilot]]

Caleb's graduation flight exam in the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] goes awry, hinting at mysteries still hidden when he and his friends graduate.

## Summary
Caleb and his dorm-mates [[Gideon]], [[Patrick]] and [[Timothy]] are preparing for their final flight test before graduating from the [[Aerospace Academy]]. ((Based on [[MC#Timeline]], the year is 2046.)) Caleb's scores are perfect in all categories--except mental health, where he has the lowest grade.

Caleb is the first to venture out into the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], and a mysterious [[Protofield]] disturbance disables his ship, nearly killing him. In the end, him giving up hope of returning is what saved him--by turning off the distress beacon, the ship's auto pilot had just enough power to get back to Earth.

Caleb spends a month recovering, and lies to MC about why he hadn't returned her messages. His recovery is miraculous, but chaotic dreams plague him after the effects of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], and memories of observation in a lab hint at [[Ever]] experimenting on him like they did on MC.

At graduation, [[Gideon]] and [[Patrick]] are selected for the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]], while [[Caleb]] is put on the alternate list. ((We know from [[Longtime Yesterday]] that he ended up joining Gideon and Patrick at the DAA as planned, and from [[Stage Observer]] that he gave the valedictorian speech.)) [[Timothy]], who was jealous of [[Caleb]] throughout, ultimately realizes his conflict was because he never really wanted to be a pilot, and he sets off onto a new path.

## Commentary

### Caleb's mental state
This anecdote hints that Caleb's sunny attitude has a dark side in that it's more dissociative than genuine. It's not that he's processed the danger or his negative feelings--he simply is able to operate as if they don't exist. This theme plays out in [[Homecoming Wings]] and his memories as well.

### Caleb and Ever
In a dream that's meant to be taken as a memory, Caleb recalls being under observation in what is almost certainly an [[Ever]] lab as they test his Gravity Evol (due to the similarities to [[Josephine's notes]] and [[Josephine's secret notes]]). It's likely that he also escaped the research facility during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] which is how he and [[MC]] ended up finding each other in the shelter, and part of why [[Grandma]] ended up taking him in too. 

His "miraculous recovery" and subsequent symptoms of dissociative amnesia and chaotic dreams (which are memories) also foreshadow [[Ever]]'s involvement in his treatment and recovery. ( #todo compare to [[Cybezin]] when adding [[Homecoming Wings]])

### Caleb hiding his injuries
This anecdote clearly establishes the pattern of Caleb hiding even serious injuries from MC. [[Hidden Waves]] explicitly confirms that this is because he wants her to feel she can depend on him, so he can't show weakness. The juxtaposition of their seemingly warm relationship, but him spending a month alone in the hospital to keep from revealing his injuries to her is telling.

# 01 Training
It's the morning that the test schedule is announced for [[Aerospace Academy]]'s graduation flight assessment in two weeks, which will determine 50% of the students' final grade and qualify the top student to join the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]].

[[Caleb]] and his bunkmates [[Gideon]] and [[Patrick]] get ready for the day. Patrick asks if they're nervous, and Gideon responds:
> "Please. Caleb's the last guy to be worried about anything."

Students cycle through the spherical centrifugal simulator, which subjects them to the intense 8gs of force they'll need to withstand as pilots.
* ((g represents the normal pull of gravity, so 8g is 8 times the normal gravitational pull.))
* ((This is realistic compared to real-world fighter pilots, where up to 9g on a normal flight or 12g in emergencies is possible. ([slashgear.com](https://www.slashgear.com/1782426/fighter-jet-how-many-gs-what-can-pilot-handle/))))

Classmate [[Timothy]] is rendered motion sick by the test. [[Patrick]] offers a sick bag while [[Gideon]] and [[Caleb]] look away. [[Caleb]] is the only one to walk out unfazed and lazily stretching--and even hungry for lunch. Caleb ranks first, to noone's surprise.
* ((His Gravity Evol allows him to control the g force on his body, easing the strain.))

Patrick reflects:
> When he was asked why he wanted to become a pilot, Caleb said that pilots earn good money and it's a respectable profession, especially since he has people to take care of. [...] Later on, they learned that Caleb entered [[Aerospace Academy]] with top marks in every subject, and one of the people he cares for is a girl about his age. She's going to become a hunter.
> "But she's tiny. She just stands there and looks like a small cupcake."
> "... I will smack you if you don't shut up."
* ((We see a bit of Caleb's protectiveness here. This anecdote further elaborates on Caleb's motives to become a pilot, and how it all comes back to [[MC]].))

Since the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], being a fighter pilot has become so dangerous that people only pursue it out of "passion and conviction." Patrolling the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] has additional strains like extended flight hours.

Many students have either failed out or quit, so a mental health course was added. Ten counseling sessions are required (ungraded). But [[Caleb]]'s score is so bad he needs to retake it--and while not a serious academic issue, his classmates are stunned. They try to figure out how it's even possible to flunk. Caleb brushes it off, saying he just missed the test that day and will retake it.

[[Gideon]] catches the lie, glancing at Caleb's phone and seeing he already has test results. In the essay portion, notices that in answer to "What do you consider to be the greatest challenge during flight missions?" he answered "It's hard to get home on time." The final result is "Psychological consultations are recommended."
Patrick says,
> "Dude, are you twisted inside?"
> "I don't know. Maybe I lost my marbles a long time ago!" Caleb replies cheerfully.

# 02 Dreams
[[Timothy]] reflects on his envy of [[Caleb]]'s apparently effortless excellence and "rising star" status--Timothy's from a family of fighter pilots and scores top marks on theory but scores poorly in practice.

After hours, he repeats the centrifuge training, stumbling out nauseous after his third attempt. Physically and mentally exhausted, he's annoyed to see [[Caleb]] watching him from the lockers nearby.
> "Caleb... what are you doing here?"
> Caleb sets down his carefully made but bland-tasting meal and hands Timothy a drink with electrolytes. 
> "I had to come in for my mental health interview. I haven't eaten yet, though. do you want some?"
> "...No thanks. Someone like you would probably get pulled into the team as a rare talent even if you failed. Since you have the Gravity Evol and all." Noticing the bitterness in his voice, Timothy quickly says in a casual tome, "But if you don't pass the assessment, then the rest of us will be failures. You act like nothing matters to you. So what's your actual reason for becoming a pilot?"
> "Well... I guess it's my childhood dream. [...] Planes can break through any barrier and go wherever you want, right?"
> "...Is that it?"
> "It does sound like something from an essay you'd write in grade school, doesn't it?" He chuckles. "But that's how I feel. If the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] happens again and the world ends, maybe I could fly somewhere and escape."
* ((Everything [[Caleb]] does is to protect [[MC]]. In other memories, he comments that if the world can be destroyed once, it can be destroyed again. ( #todo citation) He believes that by becoming a pilot who can cross space and time, he'll be able to preserve a safe place for him and MC, no matter what happens to Earth.))

Timothy is still perturbed by Caleb's casual demeanor, but he can't put a finger on why. Jealousy? Still, he's impressed that Caleb is brave enough to speak his dreams:
> It's a privilege reserved for naturally talented winners who easily achieve their goals and aren't afraid of failing because there's no gap between their dreams and reality.
> He isn't Caleb, who becomes the center of attention wherever he goes like the sun. And what that kind of star radiates isn't warmth but rather brilliance, a blinding light in itself. It makes gloomy people, like Timothy, want to look away. But the sun will always be the sun.

Caleb reflects the question back to Timothy, who says he's following in his father's footsteps and doesn't have dreams of his own. He pretends he doesn't care, but Caleb's seen how hard he's trying and offers to train with him--Timothy declines.

A week later, it's time for the graduation flight assessment. Caleb is the first to fly.
> He grasps the metal necklace he's wearing and brings the pendant to his lips for a gentle kiss. It's a ritual he performs before every flight.

The aircraft's systems fire up, and it's ready to launch.

# 03 Night Flight
The aircraft proceeds into the weightless darkness of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. 
> It's as if humanity's most primitive curiosity and desire for exploration that's encoded in their genes is being awakened. Caleb loves this feeling. Here, he is an outsider trespassing in a world that isn't his own.

The holographic map shows safe zones and unexplored swaths of darkness. Caleb's mission is to recalibrate the navigational beacons along the flight path, which mark known safe routes through the complex environment. The first six beacons are easily recalibrated, but at the last, violent turbulence occurs. [[Protofield]] anomalies spike as the video feed back to the academy goes dark.

The observation team urges Caleb to return immediately, but in a burst of static, the ship's tracker disappears from the system.

Caleb flashes back to playing hide and seek with [[MC]].
> "Don't you remember our promise? You'll be the hunter, and I'll be the pilot. With you on the ground and me in the sky, the whole world will be ours."
> "How do planes fly, though? And if you're flying around in the sky, how will you come back down?"
> "It's like flying a kite. Someone on the ground holds the string, and once the person in the sky feels a tug, they'll fly back down. When  you miss me, just whisper my name in your heart. Can you do that for me?"
> "But the ground is so far away from the sky. What if we see each other less often?"
> "Don't worry, I'll be flying in the sky above you. I'll be one glance away."
* ((This tension is a key part of their relationship--Though his motivation is to protect MC, he's often absent from her life. Even in college, they have this sky/ground duality. Caleb's casual attitude also evokes a sense of "head in the clouds".))

Caleb awakens, unsure how long he's been unconscious. The [[Protofield]] has knocked out the navigation system, and the ship is on emergency power, with only essential systems and a weak distress beacon active.
> Like a paper boat that has no way of knowing when it'll reach the shore, the aircraft drifts alone in the depths of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]].

Caleb finally acknowledges his mortality, deciding to write one last letter--but there's no pen or paper here.
> Until now, he never imagined death. To him, flying always felt like a life-affirming chase of freedom. No bird imagines falling when it takes flight.

 Caleb remembers the psychology class about the meaning of death, and how every flight comes with a risk, despite the illusion of invincibility, so you have to find a reason to keep going. Caleb finds his reason:
 > His hand moves to his chest. The necklace's pendant engraved with the words "When U Come Back" still rests closest to his heart. He can still feel the lingering warmth from when those fingers brushed against his skin.
 
# 04 Escape Velocity
A week later, the aircraft limps to an abandoned floating island far from [[Skyhaven]]'s main island. Caleb is unconscious, covered in blood, and barely alive--but he survived. The black box's recording is corrupted, so nobody knows what happened in that week. The flight data shows he veered off course and passed through "the unexplored pathless realm. The cost was three broken ribs and significant lung damage."

Only after a month in the hospital is he ready for visitors, and his three dorm-mates check on him. They brace themselves for the worst--but find Caleb cheerfully chatting with [[MC]] on the phone. He's talking about getting her a front-row seat for his graduation, then lies that someone's there to pick him up for training as he hangs up.
* ((Caleb regularly hides his injuries from MC, wanting to put on a strong face for her, and this is one such case. See also [[Hidden Waves]].))

Overall, Caleb seems to have made a miraculous recovery, even despite signs he'd been exposed to "some unknown electromagnetic radiation in the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]".

Gideon grills Caleb about his experience, and Caleb messes with him by giving a fantastical report of glowing prokaryote pets. Gideon and Patrick share the good news that they passed their flight assessments, and have a chance of getting into the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]]. Timothy confesses he's not taking the assessment, pretending it doesn't bother him, and hurries to leave. 

But upon realizing he forgot his withdrawal application in the hospital room, he doubles back and it's just him and Caleb. The truth is that even with a reduced difficulty assessment (due to [[Caleb]]'s accident) Thomas still couldn't pass, and he refuses to admit that.

Caleb asks why Thomas is quitting, and he says he's "not one of fate's chosen ones", making a wry comment about how Caleb can even easily come back from this life-or-death situation.

Caleb reveals that he deliberately cut off the distress signal.
> "I gave up on coming back. The fuel was below 10%. Even with the minimum power mode activated and the aircraft's systems only running its most essential functions, it wouldn't buy a lot of flight time. Instead of waiting for rescue, I thought I could take a chance."
> "Aren't you afraid of dying?"
> "I am. Terrified, to be honest." Caleb calmly looks at him and smiles. "But my desire to reach my destination is greater than my fear of dying."

# 05 Arrival
Gideon and Patrick wave bye from their train home as the train to [[Linkon]] City pulls in to the opposite platform. Caleb considers texting MC "I'm back" but decides he'd rather surprise her and see her reaction. Back in the [[Bloomshore District]], Caleb dodges the neighbors' greetings and requests with a smile and heads home.

He finds [[MC]] asleep at her desk in the process of wrapping a present. She's written two cards--one congratulating him on passing the assessment, the other comforting him if he didn't.

> Ever since the accident, his symptoms of dissociative amnesia have become more pronounced. Chaotic dreams are a more frequent occurrence. The doctor says these are common effects of [[Deepspace Tunnel]] navigation, and a full recovery will require an extended period of rest. The medication has sedative properties with low fever or drowsiness as side effects. It's important not to use it too often to avoid dependence.
* #todo compare this to [[Cybezin]] when adding [[Homecoming Wings]]

Caleb dreams:
> Evol Monitoring Experiment No. 742 will now commence. The test subject is Donor 002. The subject's age is approximately 9-10 years old..."
> Several pairs of hands methodically attach data monitoring electrodes to his temples. The door closes. In the pure white room, a mechanical alarm clock sits in the center of the table, its second hand ticking in a silence you'd only witness in a vacuum.
> Under multiple gazes, he raises his hand. Within moments, an invisible force compresses the mechanical clock into a metal sheet as thin as a cicada's wings.
> Time seems to stop.
> He knows he's always been good at destroying delicate things. The people behind the observation window say that the test subject will become a force comparable to a black hole given time. Not even light could escape it.
* ((Note the conspicuous similarities to [[MC]]'s experimentation in [[Josephine's notes]] and [[Josephine's secret notes]]. She is Subject 001, he's Donor 002. We can conclude that [[Ever]] is behind these experiments as well. And given the slightly suspicious circumstances of Caleb's recovery, as well as his Gravity Evol being no secret at the [[Aerospace Academy]], it's likely that Ever has continued to keep an eye on him and maybe even intervened in his recovery.))

> The dream shifts, and shadows swallow everything again. He pilots the patrol aircraft alone through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. Darkness surrounds him. Human existence blurs in absolute silence. He's reduced to an insignificant pixel, a disconnected signal in this vast universe.
> He thinks he hears a voice ask him something.
> "Does it hurt when you fall? Are you scared?"
> In the darkness, someone takes his hand. Their touch is tender, gentle.
> "No matter how many times it takes, I will always catch your hand. ...We'll always be under the same sky."
> Then the warmth of the touch vanishes. When he opens his palm, he sees a seed gleaming with a silvery-white light. It's something he's never seen before--like a tiny gift.
> In the next moment, boundless darkness closes in around him. Cold and silent, it grips his throat and slowly chokes him until he can't make a sound. These memories seem to be the only thing he can hold onto.
> The painkillers are wearing off. This isn't the first time he woke up from those chaotic dreams, and these episodes have become more frequent since his return.

The door to MC's room, which is next to his, is ajar so he quietly slips in. Sitting beside her, he watches her sleep, then takes her hand.
> He firmly holds her hand and wonders if their tightly woven palm lines are the thread that had pulled him back.
* ((Compare to the "red string of fate" which ties two people, and the memory he had in Deepspace about the kite string.))

Reflecting on the baby birds hiding from the rain outside, he wonders, "Do humans become attached to things like baby birds? He isn't sure."
* ((This reflection hints at how Caleb's memories and personalities are fragmented to the point of not quite remembering how humans are supposed to act. This also foreshadows his become more machine-like as shown in [[Homecoming Wings]].))
# 06 Graduation Ceremony
It's the graduation ceremony. The list of [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] selections is out, with [[Gideon]] and [[Patrick]] making the list. However, [[Caleb]] is at the bottom of the alternates list, with the requirement of repeating the flight assessment. [[Thomas]], in his jealosy, secretly hopes it's humilating.

But as Caleb moves through the campus in his official pilot's uniform, holding a bouquet of pale blue flowers, he has eyes only for [[MC]]. She asks:
> "You didn't contact me for two months. Are you actually not going to explain where you went?"
> "I told you, it was an intensive training exercise for situations where I'd be isolated. No communication devices were allowed."
> "Really? Don't lie to me. I'll ask Gideon and the others!"
> "Go ahead, I'm tellin' the truth. But why are you on a first-name basis with them? Am I not enough? Come here. I got this *huge* bump in the training center. But here you are, not feeling sorry for me in the slightest."
* [[Stage Observer]] reveals that he gives the valedictorian speech

They continue to bicker playfully. Thomas wonders:
> Can sheer determination carry someone through pathless realms?

He used to think that starting a journey and picking a path was most important--but now he understands that knowing your identity and destination matter too. He felt lost in pilot training because his destination wasn't there. After deciding to transfer, he finally feels a weight lifted from him.
