# Summary

((Assuming that the family visit depicted here is the one mentioned in [[01-01.09 Rainfall Curtain]], these events happen about two weeks after [[01-03 Talented Hunter]], where [[MC]] gets the [[modified Protocore]] from the [[Flux Nexus]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]))

We arrive at [[MC's childhood home]], where MC greets [[Grandma]] and finds [[Caleb]] there earlier than expected. Caleb's already fulfilled his usual role of making dinner. A heartwarming family moment is slightly disrupted by a news broadcast about recent [[Wanderer]]-related explosions. MC's [[Hunter's Watch]] gives an alert then, so MC excuses herself to go outside and check it out.

[[Caleb]] insists on going with her, then when she confronts him he claims to be only going to the grocery store. MC calls his bluff, ensuring he's in the store before making her rounds. She ends up following [[Metaflux]] fluctuations to a suspicious man in a baseball cap, but he wounds her with his (unspecified) [[Evol]] and then escapes.

Caleb and MC reunite, then head back to the house. After briefly bickering about how MC is old enough to take care of herself now, Caleb tells her to clean the blood off her sleeve before coming inside.

This pause ends up saving MC's life--an explosion occurs a moment later, engulfing [[MC's childhood home]] in flames. She's able to recover [[Caleb's necklace]].

((Later, in [[04 Homecoming Wings]], we learn that [[Caleb]] survived this explosion thanks to [[Ever]]'s intervention, though his arm couldn't be saved and was replaced with a mechanical prosthetic.))

Off-screen, MC is examined by [[Zayne]] and he agrees to let her return to working as a hunter, even though he would have recommended three months rest otherwise. She undergoes a cardiac Evol evaluation.

An unspecified amount of time later ((likely a week or two at most)), MC attends a follow-up appointment with [[Zayne]]. He gives her a small box that [[Grandma]] had left for him to give to her. Right then, a [[Wanderer]] appears in Zayne's office, even though the hospital's [[Flux Stablizer]] should prevent that possibility.

[[Zayne]] and [[MC]] deal with the [[Wanderer]], and Zayne briefly loses control of his [[Evol]]. MC heads home with the box from [[Grandma]]. The cause for the [[Wanderer]] attack is left unresolved.
