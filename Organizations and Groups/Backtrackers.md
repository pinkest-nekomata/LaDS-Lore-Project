*[[#Additional Quotes]]*
# Spacepedia
Hailing from [[Xavier]]'s hometown, this group once included members like [[Xavier]], [[Jeremiah]], and [[Soren]]. They had many companions in the past, but now only a few remain.

# Other Info

* They're from [[Philos]], in the future.
* They're all from the [[Order of Lightseekers]] ([[Shooting Stars]]).
* Though they said they were a "small group", there were quite a lot of them at one point.

## Members
(Not exhaustive)

Allies
* [[Xavier]]
* [[Jeremiah]]

Retirees:
* [[Noah]]

Traitors
* [[Isaiah]], antagonist in [[Passing By]] and dead by the time of [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]]
* [[Unnamed Backtracker]], who [[Xavier]] kills in [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]], yielding a [[Protocore]]
* [[Soren]], antagonist in [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]]
* [[duckbill cap man]], who caused the [[Bloomshore District explosion]]

([[Isaiah]], [[Soren]], and [[Unnamed Backtracker]] specifically express sentiments that [[Xavier]] was the one that abandoned/betrayed them, not the other way around.)

## Mission
There was a "mistake" in their destination ([[01-08.07 Stellar Guidance]])
* In [[Xavier's trailer]], he mentions that it's his 214th spring on Earth--and his last.
* In [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], the time is set 214 years after [[Philos]] was founded.
* This implies:
	* Earth will fail and Philos will be born sooner rather than later
	* The Backtrackers meant to arrive on Philos 214 years *after* Earth fell, so as to save [[Academy MC]] before she died. By accident, they arrived 214 years *before* Earth fell, and have been waiting for [[MC]]'s era since then.

> Something messed with the slipsace during the Backtrack. The spaceship couldn't handle the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] fluctuations. Both she and the [[Aether Core]] vanished without a trace. For all we know, they might already be cosmic dust.
