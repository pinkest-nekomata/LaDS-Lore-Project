Professor [[Shaylin]]'s increasingly urgent ramblings give clues as to the nature of [[Protofield]]s.

# Summary
Fragments from Professor [[Shaylin]]'s journal, carefully curated by her assistant, tell the story of [[Shaylin]]'s discovery of [[Protofield]] and her search for the husband and daughter she lost when they disappeared into a [[Protofield]] during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].

Shaylin is the first person to document [[Protofield]]s, giving them their name. She ends up taking notes in many [[Protofield]]s, including camping in one for a month. She doesn't know, but the reader will recognize that the traces of civilization she finds are from [[Philos]], the future version of Earth from which [[Wanderer]]s originate. 

The journal ends by describing a mysterious experience where [[Shaylin]] entered the [[Protofield]] of a harmless beetle-like [[Wanderer]] and found an infinite cosmos within which her husband seemed to still be alive, frozen in time. The story ends on an ambiguous note, with Shaylin presumed to have deposited her backpack into reality while she stayed in the [[Protofield]]. The final note is one of the assistant wishing for her to reunite with her family in the cosmos.

# 01 Scientific Observation Log
This chapter introduces the premise of this story. Professor [[Shaylin]] has left behind an observation log describing their experiences with [[Protofield]]s around the time of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], and their assistant has compiled the damaged pages. Thus, we get bits and pieces of [[Shaylin]]'s record and commentary on her mental state.

The first entry describes the Northern Forest of [[Linkon]] City (ie [[northern outskirts]]) on an unknown date in 2036. [[Shaylin]] encountered a cheetah-like [[Wanderer]], and took hasty notes from within what the reader knows is that [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protofield]]. ([[Shaylin]] doesn't use this language because it turns out she's actually the one to discover and name Protofields.)

They note three main features:
1. Ruins of what appears to be an unknown civilization's remains ((which the reader knows to be [[Philos]] because the in-game Protofields directly reference landmarks in from [[Philos]] stories))
2. Tree branches growing wild through rock crevices ((An indication that real trees literally grow here, an observation that will be corroborated later))
3. An unidentified celestial body hovering in the near sky, seemingly within reach, like a massive moon ((This is an interesting tidbit and may be something not yet known/recorded about [[Philos]], #todo))

They describe a [[gravity vortex]] as pulling them through the rift into this "alternate dimension". Shaylin uses her [[Evol]] (which involves [[physical enhancement]]) to defeat the [[Wanderer]] and is promptly dumped out of the [[Protofield]] back into "reality".

Up until this point, [[Wanderer]]s would disappear into their [[Protofield]]s just before being defeated and then reappear moments later, "as if immortal". Shaylin has just discovered how to prevent this and permanently kill a Wanderer.

# 02 New Theory

The next entry is from the 1st of an unknown month in 2034. (The CN text confirms that a MM/DD/YYYY format is used for the EN localization.)

This time, [[Shaylin]] is at Polar Glacier #4, in an ice valley between polar mountain ranges. ((Compare to the [[Arctic]] and the anomalies that later occur around [[Mt Eternal]].)) She encounters a humanoid-type [[Wanderer]], and enters its [[Protofield]] with a bunch of monitoring equipment.

Through tests including eating food in the [[Protofield]], [[Shaylin]] confirms that the alternate space exists as "physical matter", not as an illusion, because the water from the spring and wild fruit from the trees were both consumable and provided real satiation.
* ((This is one of the more consequential lore tidbits in this story. The [[Hunter Trivia - Protofields]] article poses some similar questions, and this confirms that the Protofields are more space-time distortion that illusion, reinforcing the idea that what Hunters (and players) see in Protofields is really glimpses of Philos.))

> I've developed a new hypothesis.
> Field experience indicates that the physical dimensions of explored alternate spaces correlate with the different species and specifications of Wanderers. This humanoid-type Wanderer proves far more dangerous than the previous animal-type, and its escape route led to an alternate space vastly larger than any I've studied before.
> I believe there exists a positive correlation between the size of the planetary Protofield spaces and the Wanderers' power levels...
* Note: A "positive correlation" simply means that as the power level goes up, the size of the space also goes up. (A "negative correlation" means that if one thing goes up, the other goes down.)
* "Planetary Protofield spaces" shouldn't be interpreted to mean that each field is its own "planet" in the EN sense, "planetary" is likely being used in more vague/general terms, see also [[celestial bodies in CN]].

On a more personal note, [[Shaylin]] confesses to wondering that if [[Wanderer]]s can escape into their [[Protofield]]s and these are physical places, perhaps their victims may also have escaped to some similar place. ((Later, we learn that [[Shaylin]] lost her husband and child during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].))

# Chaos and Rebirth

This entry is at Protofield #1012, and the assistant notes that the date has been modified. The year is 203X, Month is X, Day is X6 (so, likely 16 or 26, potentially 6)

The assistant notes that the date appears to be that of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], which would have been before [[Shaylin]]'s first entry, since [[Wanderer]]s only started appearing during the catastrophe. The assistant suggests that based on the erratic handwriting, [[Shaylin]] was disoriented and perhaps experiencing "temporal confusion" (i.e. confusion about the time/date).
* ((Note that [[WU-04 From The Stars]] implies that the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] occurred in summer of 2034.))
* Given the modification of the year, we can conclude that this entry actually happened in 2035, since Shaylin disappeared in "early 2036".

[[Shaylin]] is in a desert region and encounters a possible [[Intelligentia Type]] [[Wanderer]]. (Note that these Wanderers can cause mental disturbances which may partially explain her state.) She notes these features:
1. Habitable climate with abundant geological resources
2. Infrastructure remarkably similar to real-world settlements
3. Vast expanse extending beyond visible limits, suggesting massive spatial dimensions
4. Signs of previous habitation?? Evidence of past occupancy?? ((The assistant notes the handwriting here indicates emotional turmoil, likely because the hint at past occupants could be interpreted by Shaylin as a clue that [[Wanderer]]s victims, like her family, remained alive here.))

**Commentary**: These are all known features of [[Philos]], and the signs of habitation are most likely from [[Philos]]ians, not from past Wanderer victims as Shaylin hopes. However, elements of that conclusion remain open-ended.

[[Shaylin]] deliberately removed the "experiment purpose" section, then details the month that she spent camping in the [[Protofield]]. This tidbit stands out:
> The [[Protofield]]'s energy signature differs completely from Earth's, showing striking similarities to Wanderer energy patterns instead... Could Wanderer interference be affecting my readings?
* ((One potential interpretation is that the energy readings are actually due to [[Philos]]'s artificial core, which we know involves consuming human energy to sustain itself and results in the formation of Wanderers. ([[Shooting Stars]]) It's another clue connecting the appearance of [[Wanderer]]s to properties of [[Philos]] itself.))

Shaylin notes that she still can't find any previous residents, and is beginning to experience hallucinations due to running out of medication. One line stands out to the assistant: "science can resurrect the dead".

The reason for her distress soon becomes clear. When her writing becomes lucid again, [[Shaylin]] reveals that her husband [[Chadwik]] and daughter [[Queenie]] disappeared into a [[Wanderer]] [[Protofield]] during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. The only reason [[Shaylin]] wasn't there at the time was because she was working overtime ((so she experiences intense survivor's guilt)). Shaylin insists she won't give up on trying to find them.

The rest of the entry was torn out, but the research institute confirmed that [[Shaylin]] eventually returned.

# 04 Beyond Solution

This log entry is back on [[Linkon]] City Streets, on the first of an unknown month in 2036. (Later this is confirmed to be early 2036). She notes that her condition deteriorated and she's taken a forced break from her research and is in poor spirits:
> The Institute has given up on me, and so has my intellect. I have nothing left. Yet I still believe in what I believe... I'm just waiting for the right moment.

[[Shaylin]]'s final entry is peculiar yet lucid, insisting that the reader believe her:
* She encounters a tiny, harmless, beetle-like Wanderer.
* When she brushes it off, its panic creates a tiny rift. When she touches the rift, she's sucked into "the infinite cosmos."

> All of existence dwelled within that tiny rift, like glimpsing an ocean within a single droplet of water.
> Before I could process it all, I felt a gentle touch on the back of my hand. When I turned around, there was [[Chadwik]], unchanged, as if time had frozen around him.
> "Let's go. Queenie got out of school early today. She's waiting for us at home," I heard him say with a smile.
> Outstanding Issues: Now we can return to the universe together. I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long.

The journal ends there. The assistant notes that it was recovered in her belongings on a remote mountainside. To support the idea that it's not mere hallucinations, the assistant notes, "no one can explain how her backpack traveled overnight from the streets of [[Linkon]] City to mountains hundreds of miles away, nor where she herself has gone."
* ((We can thus conclude that [[Shaylin]] was right, and the [[Protofield]]s allow for true space-time distortion--though it's left open-ended whether Shaylin is truly able to "live" with her husband and child again, or whether they simply vanish into the cosmos and thus "die" together. We can infer that she deliberately deposited her backpack outside of the [[Protofield]] at some point so that her notes could be found.))

The end of the chapter gives a biography of the professor, written by her assistant, which is documented in the [[Shaylin]] page.
