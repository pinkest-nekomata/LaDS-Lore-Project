A promotional video for 3.0 gave the following themes for each love interest:

Caleb: Lucid/sober/clear-headed vs indulge/addiction
Sylus: Abyss vs revelry/carnival (i.e. nothingness vs excess)
Rafayel: Contract vs betrayal/divergence
Zayne: Reality vs Nightmare
Xavier: Promise vs reverse/contrary/difficult/adverse path

Additional notes:
* A twitter commentor said that Raf's "betrayal" is more accurately translated as "divergence" ([link](https://x.com/Nekonek88847129/status/1924854562118369433))
* Xavier's "wrong path" is better translated as "adverse path" or "difficult path"
