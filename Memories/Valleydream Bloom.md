# Summary
Sylus and MC discuss ordinary moments while seeing a blockbuster movie at the mall, agreeing to go on a spring outing together after MC returns from her mission. At the mission location, MC goes undercover to join a deadly hunting game at an old castle (later revealed to be [[Sylus's castle]]) that pits [[Wanderer]]s against human contestants. After saving a fellow contestant from a [[Wanderer]], [[MC]] flees guards and finds [[Sylus]] in a VIP viewing room.

He helps her get to the game's organizer, allowing the [[Hunters Association]] to deal with the criminals. With the threat cleared, [[MC]] stays and the next day Sylus takes her on an outing to show why he purchased the castle. Nearby is a [[mist-veiled dimension]] containing a massive dragon's skeleton. The kindled scene depicts them climbing around the flower-draped skeleton. As they leave, Sylus assures her that this world wasn't a dream, and he offers to take her to all such worlds he's found.

# Quotes

> Sylus: I'm an honest audience member. I look at whatever catches my interest.

> Sylus: Only someone with a death wish would close their eyes for 20 minutes in one of the N109 Zone's public facilities.
> MC: That place is really dangerous, which is why we should enjoy these peaceful moments in Linkon.

> MC: Is the game so boring that you need a book to kill time? I saw your study full of history books, but I didn’t know you were interested in mythology too.
> Sylus: Since you’re here, it’s no longer the most interesting thing in the room. If you want to leave safely, I’m here to help whenever you need.

> Sylus: Play along, kitten. Struggle.

> Sylus: “Shh… be a good girl and stay quiet.”

> MC: You talk too much.
> Sylus: We really are becoming more alike.

> Sylus: Our time together is fun yet brief. However, working with you never fails to put me in a good mood. Maybe we should find another opportunity to cooperate. It’d be even better if it lasted longer.

> MC: This means your ‘dedication’ isn’t just about a spring outing.
> Sylus: You’re one step away from solving this mystery, kitten. And you’ll take that step tomorrow.

> MC: Who knew the leader of Onychinus could act like a kid? He’ll get new clothes for a spring excursion. Aren’t you worried I’ll take pictures and use them to blackmail you?
> Sylus: If this is the only dirt anyone has on me, it better be worth looking at multiple times. Besides, anyone who sees these photos should be able to tell that the other person in them… is my accomplice.

> MC: …How can someone take amazing photos without even trying?
> Sylus: Should we… add more photos of us together to the album then? Since you approve of my photography skills.

> MC: …It’s exactly what was written in the book. This surpasses normal logic.
> *Sylus gives a slight smile and takes my hand. He leads me toward these remains.* 
> Sylus: Let’s just say… we entered another world when we walked through that mist. And… if we want to be more specific, it’s a world with dragons.

> MC: You wanted that castle so you can keep others from discovering this world?
> Sylus: “This place won’t reveal itself to most people anyway. Only those who know the riddle can find its answer.”

> Sylus: You’re getting better at bossing me around. As I wished.

> Sylus: Bossing around the leader of Onychinus… isn’t exactly blackmail. We’re partners in crime.

> Sylus: Will you watch the video every night before bed?
> MC: Yeah. I’ll imagine a little dragon sleeping peacefully in his flower-covered lair…
> Sylus: The flower petals have carried you into this dragon’s dreams. \[...] If every petal could receive this kind of reward…Then this dragon will wait every night longing for the wind and petals to arrive.
