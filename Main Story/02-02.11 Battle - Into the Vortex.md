**Description**
> A [[Flux Nexus]] shimmers beneath the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], but the fluctuations show that something is off. This isn't just a [[Protocore]]. The moment I touch it, the whole tunnel trembles...

Companion: [[Sylus]]

[[Wanderer]](s)
* [[Arbiterwings]]

# Notes
The [[Arbiterwings]]'s [[Protofield]] is the place where [[Sorceress MC]] faced her [[Heavenly Tribulation]] (judgement by lightning) on [[Philos]] in [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]]. Sylus would instantly recognize the Protofield.

The following voicelines play.

*Start of battle*
MC: **“There’s a lot of Metaflux… this one’s going to be tricky.”**
Sylus: **“All bark and no bite.”**

*During battle*
**“Dammit, I still can’t resonate.”**
**“Hurry, destroy the feathers now.”**

Once the battle is completed, the [[Arbiterwings]] winds up a massive attack that sweeps the entire [[Protofield]], effectively knocking [[MC]] and [[Sylus]] out of it.
