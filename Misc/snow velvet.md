> "Greyson curls his finger and reaches for a small potted plant with white buds nestled in snow. [...] catching a glimpse of snowflakes swirling in Zayne's palm, he watches them land in the flowerpot. The previously wilted stem seems to come alive, and the bud raises itself as if being gently awakened. His fingertip traces across the sepals, caressing them like a beloved's face."

There's a species of real-world white flower sometimes called the [snow velvet](https://plantlust.com/plants/37558/philadelphus-lewisii-snow-velvet/), but its more common colloquial name is [mockorange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphus_lewisii).

[[jasmine]] is the thematic flower for [[Zayne]] and MC, and if nothing else, this is also a white flower. Potentially, the idea is that in-world the snow velvet is meant to be interpreted as a kind of jasmine, or at least is meant to tie to the jasmine theme.
