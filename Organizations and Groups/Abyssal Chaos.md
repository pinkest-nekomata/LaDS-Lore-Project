Abyssal Chaos is both a game mode for players and an entity that exists within the game's universe.

# Spacepedia
> An anonymous virtual platform. It's primarily used to publish and sell information as well as commissions. No one knows who created it, but the creator is unfathomably skilled. As a result, the Abyssal Chaos is the most secretive and powerful platform on the dark web.

# Game Mode
From the game mode help section:
> The Abyssal Chaos is an anonymous virtual platform hidden in the depths of the cyber world. It's primarily used for intel trading and posting commissions. Once you accept a commission, the administrator [[AI]] of the Abyssal Chaos, [[Wontony]], will deduce and record the commission process. Rewards and points will be issued based on the commission's progress. Wontony has a semi-AR mode that influences real-world battles. But it's important to note that the potent abilities acquired within the Abyssal Chaos are confined to the virtual realm. They cannot be manifested in reality or beyond the scope of Wontony's capabilities.

> **Deductions**
> 1. Wontony will pick out the most suitable commissions for you based on your needs and situation. You can choose a Companion to start the Deduction and uncover the truth of the case.
> 2. During the Deduction process, you will face different choices. Your choices may affect the outcome of the Deduction.
> 3. Starting a Deduction with different Companions may reveal new paths. It will help you experience the case from various perspectives.
> 4. Strengthen Genes and choose different Codes and Items during Deductions to experience various combat scenarios.

# Commentary
The Abyssal Chaos has a variety of functions:
## Augmented reality commissions
The game mode showcases the augmented reality (AR) commissions, where the "operative" goes out in the real world (for example, to [[Vagrants Land]] or to the [[abandoned sanitarium]]) and [[Wontony]] uses its AR capabilities to influence real-world battles, as mentioned in the Abyssal Chaos overview. In this case, the multiple endings can be thought of as [[branching timelines]], as is the case with Memoria and Bonds where the player can choose different dialogue options.

Given the overall virtual reality/augmented reality theming, and the fact that it's a game mode for players, the exact line between "virtual" and "physical" that the characters would experience isn't fully clear--and this ambiguity is likely intentional. That being said, it seems fair to assume that each commission/case does "exist" in the world--ie, clients are always real people, the locations mentioned are real locations, etc.

## Simulation commissions
In [[WU-18 Depths of Chaos]], we also see [[Wontony]] giving out commissions that appear to be primarily simulations, including of events that already occurred in the past. (Past events would theoretically have one "true" ending which already occurred, but other possibilities could be explored.) Wontony seems to use these simulations to develop a deeper understanding of humanity.

Given the game's theme of [[branching timelines]] and [[converging timelines]], an interesting idea is that the various simulation pathways might actually represent [[Wontony]] being able to access alternate timelines in order to analyze what would have happened. The blurring of simulation and reality seems like an intentional decision as part of the game's storytelling.

## Information exchange
Typical intel and information exchange is another key function, with Abyssal Chaos being a key entity on the dark web.
