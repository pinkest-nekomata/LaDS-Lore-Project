# Summary

The [[Wanderer]] attack on the train occurred at the same time as other sudden fluctuations across [[Linkon]] city. The source seems to be in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]], so MC and other hunters are sent to investigate. MC is supposed to wait for her assigned partner (who we later learn is [[Xavier]], but they haven't showed up.

Note: It's unclear whether this occurs on the same day as the train attack, or the next day.

# Details

We start outside [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] at night.

Commission screen:
> Deepspace Hunter Commission
> Level ?
> Location: No-Hunt Zone 7
> Status: Active
> Task Details: [Order No.85] A sudden fluctuation occurred in some districts of [[Linkon]] City. Please proceed to investigate and resolve the crisis.
> Objective: Clear the Source of Fluctuation

The screen flashes with special permissions to enter the No-Hunt zone, which would normally be off-limits to hunters due to the danger level. [[Jenna]] states that the [[Alpha Team]] needs to work in pairs due to the danger. However, [[MC]]'s companion signal won't connect--her assigned partner isn't showing up.

MC notes that several other locations in [[Linkon]] had [[Wanderer]] activity at the same time as the train, indicating that the train attack wasn't a random occurrence.

Radio chatter indicates that hunter pairs have entered zones I and III. MC waits at the entrance to zone IV, reporting that her partner hasn't arrived yet. (Note, these are sub-zones within No-Hunt Zone 7.)
