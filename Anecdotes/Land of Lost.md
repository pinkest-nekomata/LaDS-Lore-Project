# Anecdote
Relevant LI: [[Sylus]]
Main POV character: [[Sylus]], [[Myer]]
Associated Companion: [[Sylus - Otherworldly Visitor]]

Before arriving in the [[N109 Zone]] in search of [[MC]], Sylus is a space pirate.
## Summary
[[Sylus]] is the Most Wanted criminal in [[Philos]]'s history and the only to escape [[space-time prison]]. The [[Astral Enforcer]]s have all but given up on trying to apprehend him, especially since his crime sprees, while impressive, never seem to disturb life for the everyday star citizen.

Sylus sets his sights on his next target--[[Feathers Planet]] and its [[Overlord]]. He infiltrates a ship heading to the planet for the Overlord's upcoming birthday, crashing it into the lord's fortress to create a way in. Once there, he finds the Overlord in his treasury, subjects him to mind control, and sets the next phase of his plan in motion.

Puppeting the Overlord, Sylus commands the [[High Lords]] to bring even more tribute than usual. Once they all arrive for the birthday celebration, he springs his trap. Now that they're under control, he demands 100 ship's worth of treasure from each of them. All the lords can pay the price--save one. Sylus allows him to offer up intel instead, and his accusation sets the rest of the lords off. In the chaos, one reveals that the [[Overlord]] has an [[Eye of Aether]]--and suddenly, Sylus sees the hand of fate. He's long been searching for the [[Aether Core]] that will lead him to [[MC]], and the Eye will help him find it.

Deciding to let fate take care of the high lords too, he simply unleashes the [[Overlord]]'s caged beasts and leaves. The beasts exact their revenge, killing everyone.

Back in space, it's revealed that Sylus sent all the rest of the treasure back to its rightful owners, and he uses the [[Eye of Aether]] to locate [[MC]]'s [[Aether Core]] on Earth. He asks his ship AI to choose a suitable location for him, and it recommends the [[N109 Zone]].

Sylus arrives, quickly takes on his leather motorcycle jacket to blend in, and then sets about becoming the zone's new ruler.
## Commentary

### Timing
#### Philos
This anecdote reveals much about the interplanetary travel possible in the time of [[Philos]]. We have a [[space-time prison]], [[Astral Enforcer]]s, holographic star maps, and more. We can (and indeed must) conclude that time travel is also possible here, especially since the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] exists over Earth during the [[spacetime]] that [[Sylus]] is targeting.

Refer to the [[Philos]] page for more discussion on possible interpretations of the overall timeline here, especially since [[Beyond Cloudfall]] raises some interesting questions about Sylus's timeline and how it all fits together.

#### Arrival to Earth
This must take place after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] forms the [[N109 Zone]] (2034) but far enough before the events of [[WU-10 Mischief]] (2046) that [[Onychinus]] is already well-established at that point. Other than that, it's uncertain--and as far as we know, not particularly consequential. ((Based on nothing more than vibes, I'd think of him arriving relatively early in the N109 Zone's history, so around 2034-2036, since he and [[Onychinus]] are more or less synonymous with the [[N109 Zone]].))

### Characterization
Despite Sylus's intimidating aura, we already see he has a soft spot for animals (as is shown repeatedly in his memories and event stories) and for everyday people. He's portrayed as a robin-hood type character here, emptying the High Lords coffers so he can sort all the treasures back to their rightful owners.

### Evol, Eye, and Power Level
Sylus's Evol is one of the more mysterious ones, especially since it's less an elemental Evol and more a representation of the demonic powers common in [[Xianxia]] fiction. We do see it has limits, though it takes a while to get there.

Additional powers of [[Sylus's Eye]] are also revealed--not only does it uncover hidden desires, but it can explicitly achieve mind control and mental domination. This is hinted at in [[Beyond Cloudfall]] but not directly depicted.

### Minor translation notes
* The location [[Feathers Planet]] is translated in-game as "Feathers Star" because the CN has one word that means both "star" and "planet" but this is very confusing in EN, so I've renamed it for clarity here.
* "Land of Lost" is a bit of an awkward title. Per the source below (in the GDoc that is no longer available, so I'm relying on memory) this could also be translated "No Man's Land", and Google Translate gives a literal translation of "A/the realm/land without a Master"
* Sylus is "most wanted" in EN and the CN explicitly states he has the highest bounty in Philos's history. ((An appropriate localization, but also a neat bit of trivia.))
* When Sylus's "invisible tether" causes him to not be able to "tap into" more power, this can also be translated as "internal shackles" that prevent him from "absorbing" more power.
	* Google Translate: "...the energy he could control had reached the upper limit, and the invisible shackles in his body prevented him from drawing more power again.
	* For fanfic/theory purposes, I think Sylus being able to "absorb" power fits with the vibe of an "Energy Manipulation" Evol and creates some interesting possibilities, but otherwise the meaning is essentially the same; even Sylus's power isn't infinite.

# 01 High Alert
> [[Dri-Lar-404]], [[Feathers Planet]]
> A fully loaded spaceship returns to a planet shaped like a black diamond.
* Because "star" and "planet" are interchangeable in CN, in-game this is "Feathers Star" but that is VERY confusing in EN, so I've rename dit "Feathers Planet" here for clarity.

The ship has "scoured the galaxy for rare treasures--gifts for the [[Overlord]]'s birthday" and a young deputy is miffed to be forced to go through many checkpoints like a "petty criminal". The Captain informs him it's because [[Sylus]] has been spotted nearby:
> "Most wanted criminal in [[Philos]]'s history. The only one to ever escape the [[space-time prison]]. A real legend."
> With a skeptical look, the Deputy mutters, "Sure, but that's in [[Philos]]. If he swings by here, he won't be a big deal."
> "Then why is the [[Overlord]] making us jump through all these hoops?"
> The Deputy pauses, still cocky as ever.
> "While the [[Overlord]] was conquering other planets, this [[Sylus]] probably wasn't even a twinkle in his old man's eye!"
> "He was lucky," a deep voice from behind says.
> Startled, they stand up, their hands going to where their weapons should be. But their holtsers are empty.
> Two strange swirls of black-red mist, as if obeying a master, hover in midair. Each cradles a gun.
> Emerging from the spaceship's shadows, a tall figure appears, his striking features matching the wanted poster on the flickering holographic screen. With each step, mist emanating from his hand coils around the two frightened men, as if claiming its prey.
> His lips curl into a faint smirk, but his eyes carry a deeper message.
> "But the [[Overlord]]'s luck has run out."

Sylus coerces the Captain into giving the correct password and biometric scan at the final checkpoint, and they proceed into the airspace above [[Feathers Planet]]'s capital.

The Deputy warns Sylus:
> "You're walking into a trap. You know nothing of the Overlord's might."
> Meanwhile, Sylus lounges on the couch behind them, idly toying with the confiscated guns. He's unfazed.
> "That depends on whether or not his trap can handle the weight of a spaceship."
> "What the..."
> The Captain and Deputy exchange a panicked look. But before they can react, tendrils of black-red mist coil around their arms, yanking them toward the spaceship's control panel.
> "No, stop! Are you out of your mind? We're all gonna die!"
> Click. A crisp noise fills the air, bones giving way under pressure.
> Amidst streams of agony, their twisted arms are puppeteered by the mist to jab at the control panel's buttons.
> "Unfortunate. I thought the Captain had a brain cell."
> it's the last thing the Captain hears as the ship dips and hurls toward the [[Overlord]]'s fortress.

# 02 Absolute Suppression
A great fire burns, illuminating the night.
> The fully-armed [[Overlord]] hurries to the depths of his fortress, where lies a treasured bunker. It was with these very implements that he subdued [[Feathers Planet]], turning it into a cesspool of vice that leaves galaxies full of dread. As for the army outside, each soldier is a villain, their hands stained with blood...

Sylus makes quick work of said army, and the [[Overlord]] hears the screaming and chaos. Sylus's mist reaches around the supposedly impenetrable vault door and yanks the [[Overlord]] to the biometric device that unlocks the door.

Sylus enters, surprised that the [[Overlord]] is in his treasure vault, not the armory--it saves Sylus some work. The Overlord offers [[Sylus]] his treasure, as he "knows when to yield to a superior adversary."

> Sylus sits on the Diamond Throne, crafted by the [[Overlord]] himself. The mist obediently fetches the treasures from a cabinet.
> "The Dawn Galaxy's Nebula Stone, Rainharp's Holy Crystal... You've certainly pludnered your fair share of places."

The [[Overlord]] tries to appeal to Sylus, saying they're the same if Sylus recognizes these treasures so easily. He tries to make a deal, but his fake grin is out of practice.

> Sylus lets out a lazy chuckle as if a bad joke was just told. "Unfortunately, none of the loot here will satiate my appetite."
> "What do you want?"
> Sylus raises a finger, the mist pulling the Overlord to him. He leans in and locks eyes with the Overlord, and his right eye emits a faint glow.
> "I had to embark on a long journey. What I want is the whole planet. Is that okay?"
> The [[Overlord]]'s gaze starts to glaze over as he plops down to the ground, staring blankly at the man on the throne.
> His lips twitch uncontrollably. "...Yes."
* [[Sylus's Eye]] is not only capable of revealing desires, but also of mind control / mental domination, as seen later in this anecdote as well.

# 03 Mysterious Visitor
Sylus continues pulling the strings at the fortress. The damage is being repaired, and the planet prepares for the [[Overlord]]'s birthday celebration. Though the requirements for tributes are raised, this fits with the Overlord's "history of being a greedy and capricious dictator", so nobody questions it.

Meanwhile, it's rumored a mystery guest is occupying the Overlord's time. Indeed, we see Sylus in toying with the Overload:
> "You lost again." Smirking, Sylus flips the king on the chessboard. "You already coughed up 97 spaceships. To fill them back up, you'll need a lot of gifts. Can you do it?"
> "That's nothing..." The Overlord, stuck on his throne by the mist, manages to flash a grin. Only during a game of chess is he allowed to have a brief moment of clarity. "As long as I give you what you want, you'll let me go, right?"
> Sylus nonchalantly resets the chessboard. "I prefer a nice 100 over 97."
> Bastard!
> For the first time in his rotten life, this slips into the wicked Overlord's thoughts. But he keeps up his eager facade. "Sure, sure."

The throne overlooks floor-to-ceiling windows leading out to an artificial garden, stocked with growling beasts with glowing eyes. The Overlord reveals they were gifts from [[High Lords]] across the land, and offers them to Sylus. Sylus replies, "A cage is no place for beasts."

The ships of tribute line up at the port, and the [[High Lords]] arrive for the birthday celebration--and a trap.
> As they settle down in the banquet hall, the room' fancy, crystal chandeliers suddenly go out, plunging everyone into darkness. In the shadows, red mist moves like vines and seals off all entrances and exits.

((How many High Lords are they? The most specificity we get in the EN localization is "several", based on the math with the number of ships later seen leaving [[Feathers Planet]].))

Sylus dramatically lights a candle and places it into an elaborate cake in the center of the table, then addresses the crowd. Making a show of wishing "today's star" a happy birthday, he taps the area around his right eye to release the Overlord from his spell, and he sees all the [[High Lords]] ensnared.

Sylus says, "You've been around for a long, long time. Missing one birthday won't be the end of the world." In a gruesome display of control, he cuts the Overlord's mouth with a knife smeared with frosting.
> The undisputed ruler of this planet is being played like a fool. It's a sight that, combined with the name "Sylus", leaves the long-extravagant [[High Lords]] powerless to fight back.

As a High Lord mentions their army outside, the armory explodes, stunning the crowd. 
> "Now, it's your turn to show some sincerity." He stands up and pats the Overlord's shoulder. "The Overlord's life is a storage's worth of treasures from 100 ships. Anyone who brings less might not taste the birthday cake today."
* Later descriptions make it clear that Sylus expects *each* High Lord to bring treasure worth 100 ships.
* ((Sincerity is a bit of a recurring theme with Sylus, see also [[Sylus#Sincerity]]))

# 04 Out of Reach
[[Astral Enforcer]] [[Myer]] dreams of arresting Sylus and returning him to [[space-time prison]], just like that first Enforcer did. His boss is wiser than such dreams, though.
> Myer's best shot at capturing Sylus was in the capital of [[Philos]]. Maybe Sylus assumed the most dangerous spot was the safest because that notorious fugitive strolled in like he owned the place.
> But soon enough, Myer realized that Sylus didn't even see those people trying to arrest him as a threat.
> The traps set by the Enforcers were like spider webs, crumbling at the slightest touch in the face of overwhelming power. Some squad members, their brains having experienced mind control, were never the same and left the job for good.
> After that, word of Sylus's whereabouts drifted through the space regions like a nightmare. Every sighting was paired with crimes. Yet as unbelievable as they are, these acts somehow never affect the space citizens' lives. Many have become legends, in fact. So for most Astral Enforcers, catching Sylus was an impossible dream.

Only [[Myer]] is keen on pursuing the [[Feathers Planet]] lead, especially since the place is "like a swamp overrun by crooks." He arrives alone, seeing the "insane number of ships lined up at the port" which indicate "countless planets and regions were pillaged." [[Feathers Planet]] soldiers arrive to take military control of the ships.

# 05 Judgement of Fate
> After using up a substantial amount of energy for several days, Sylus can keenly feel he's hit his limit. An invisible tether within him holds him back from tapping into more power.
* ((See the commentary above for a translation note about "shackle" vs "tether" here))

Sylus muses that his captives might have stood a chance of they were keen enough to notice the mist losing its grip, but they were easily broken and have given up. Each High Lord has met the required tribute, until the last:
> It's clear this last one is unable to cough up an amount equal to a hundred ships.

Sylus replies:
> "Sometimes, real treasures aren't what you see with your eyes. [...] A nugget of valuable intel often fetches a sliver of life."

The High Lord quickly turns on his peer, saying he has enough of a fortune to fill 200 ships. Then in chaos the rest of the lords turn on each other as well, "spilling secrets as easily as snow falls in winter", until one mentions an [[Aether Core]], causing Sylus to stop fidgeting with the brooch he's holding. (([[Sylus's brooch]]?))
> "Have you ever heard of the '[[Eye of Aether]]'? The [[Overlord]] stashe dit away in the vaults beneath the Northfall Mountains..."

The Overlord's reaction reveals the accusation is true.

Sylus muses:
> He always relishes those absurd twists of fate, just like now, when the elusive echo in the cosmic void he's relentless pursued unveils itself unexpectedly.
* This is a reference to [[MC]]

On the horizon, a fleet of ships departs from the port.
> Whenever the stars align perfectly, Sylus finds himself entertaining thoughts of destiny.
> Now is the time to act on it.
* Minor translation note from the same source as noted in commentary above, a more literal translation is that he "believes" in destiny sometimes. The localization is a bit more flippant and noncommittal, which fits the overall EN localization. But given Sylus's sincerity and fate themes, for fanfic/theory purposes, the takeaway that he sometimes sincerely believes in fate is helpful.

Sylus thus decides to leave the survival of the [[High Lords]] up to destiny as well, shooting out the windows that hold back the trapped beasts in the artificial garden.
> "Let's see what's left of you after spending so much time in captivity." His right eye scans ech bestial gaze.
> The turmoil in them begins to settle, replaced by a simmering hatred akin to blades being unsheathed in the darkness. Their thirst for vengeance is directed at those responsible for hunting, butchering, and imprisoning them.
* This use of [[Sylus's Eye]] is to awaken their desires

The beasts descend upon the [[High Lords]], tearing them apart and exacting their revenge.

[[Myer]]'s fellow [[Astral Enforcer]]s discuss the gruesome scene, calling it the Night of Blood, and noting "several hundred" ships left the port that night, heading out to various planets before their signals disappeared. Myer combs the footage for clues, and finds a blood-soaked brooch; "something made from the same material as this brooch was there when Sylus escaped from [[Philos]]". But the other enforcers aren't impressed, saying the material is centuries old and has been used in many things, so they can't be certain.
* ((This "material" is likely the red gem stone seen in [[Sylus's brooch]].))

The Enforcers ironically comment that it's far-fetched even for Sylus to have plundered a whole planet, and then we find out the beasts were spared from extinction.

# 06 Journey Begins
Sylus listens to classical music and drinks coffee along his journey.

He converses with a contact, revealing that all the treasures have been returned to their rightful owners--except for one treasure, the [[Eye of Aether]]:
> Sylus glances at the floating, transparent orb, tiny blue lights dancing within it. They're seemingly propelled by an unseen force, constantly gathering and dispersing.

The contact asks about the next score, but Sylus replies it's not "something you can grab" before ending the call. He then summons the ship's holographic star map. The [[Eye of Aether]] reveals its function as the tiny lights scatter, then coalesce on a location. Sylus zooms in, and the map indicates the destination is surrounded in strong energy fluctuations.

He commands the AI system to find him a location, and it centers on the [[N109 Zone]]:
>"Location found. The area is currently experiencing substantial [[Protofield]] disturbances, creating a massive vortex of magnetic fields. This twists and refracts light, rendering direct entry impossible. It is forever shrouded in darkness."

Sylus comments it's a fitting choice, and the autopilot starts the journey.

Upon landing in the [[N109 Zone]], Sylus's interstellar appearance makes him a conspicuous target, which he realizes as the "lucky" thirteenth would-be mugger tries to attack him. Sylus asks "What's the fashion like around here?" and the stunned man points at a billboard depicting a leather-clad man on a motorcycle which will inspire Sylus's new look.

>The N109 Zone is about to greet its new ruler.
