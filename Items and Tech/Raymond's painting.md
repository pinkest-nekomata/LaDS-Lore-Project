"A stunning oil painting hangs on the wall opposite the sofa. It depicts a brilliantly blue sea with cascading white waves. Each brush stroke feels alive as if countless fairies are jumping out of the water. At the edge of the sea, the water is gradually stained crimson like something is being torn apart, swallowed, and coalescing into a blood clot." -- [[01-02.05 Artsy Dreams]]

"Despite the gallery being filled with better paintings, he was utterly smitten with that one. He needed to buy it." -- [[Thomas]] describing [[Raymond]], [[01-02.07 Heard About It]]
* Thomas has to nag him to get him to sell it
* ((This could have been an intentional trap for Raymond all along.))

When scanned for [[Metaflux]], nothing is detected.

However, when [[MC]] attempts to resonate with the painting, she has a vision.

"The gloomy weather, the sound of the ocean--a salty humidity slowly creeps into my hair. ... I come back to my senses and realize I'm standing in the ocean. I turn around and spot a girl by the shore, the lower half of her body submerged in the water. Strange. It's almos as if she's crying and laughing at the same time. The swirling fog carries a faint, ethereal melody on the sea breeze. It sounds like a song, yet is also a lament.

I can't help but move toward her. But the fog becomes increasingly dense, and everything begins to blur. A chilling cold gradually surrounds me..." -- [[01-02.05 Artsy Dreams]]

The OST name of this song is "Song of Lost".

A conversation in [[Flux Arts]], [[01-02.07 Heard About It]]:
* MC: So what's the story behind this painting?
* Rafayel AI: A dream. (His voice is suddenly softer, carrying an indescribable sadness.) When I was a kid, I had dreamed I turned into a fish. I swam and swam and swam from the deep sea, seeking a place beyond the water's surface, only to end up in blood red sea water.
* MC inner monologue: The light shifts with his voice, casting a shimmering gleam. It's like looking at the glittering waves. The room seems to ebb and flow like the sea. A pinkish hue gradually shifts into a dark crimson.
* MC: Why did the sea turn red?
* Rafayel AI: It was the first time I saw such a color. Who know show many years I've spent trying to recreate it. But I never really could get that same shade of red. It was always a slightly different hue, you know...
* MC inner monologue: For some reason, I can almost hear the faint melody from Raymond's mansion again...

**Commentary:**
In [[Intertidal Zone]], we learn that [[Rafayel]] has historically sought pain as his inspiration. This affirms that the dream and the shade of red are painful ones. There is likely also a connection to [[Raymond's Lemurian skeleton]].
