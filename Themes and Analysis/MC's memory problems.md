MC remembers nothing before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], and has nightmares of fragmented memories of the catastrophe itself.

[[Josephine's secret notes]] reveal that when the [[Gaia Research Center]] killed MC to test her [[Aether Core]], this wiped her memories each time. (This happened twice.) MC's memory remained unstable for a time after this. Caleb mentions being willing to introduce himself to her as many times as she needs, just like then. ( #todo I think this is [[Lucid Dreams]])

In [[02-02.12 Resonance's Power]], MC starts to remember fragments of [[Philos]]. In [[03-01.01 Imbalance]], she wonders if her sense of unclear and fragmented memories is due to the [[Aether Core]].
