> That night, the blood in his hands kept dripping onto the ground, dripping into his dreams. The summer when he was 12 was extraordinarily long. Every little thing--like the ivy climbing up the courtyard wall, the stall that sells popsicles, the swings in the park--is clear in his mind, as if it were yesterday.
> A snowstorm ended that summer.
> It was the first time a black-robed [[Grim Reaper]] appeared in his dreams.

* Commentary:
	* Several different pieces of evidence point to the summer Zayne was 12 as being the year *before* the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. Additionally, the memories of the summer don't include the catastrophe, which would likely be mentioned if it had happened that year.
	* However, this makes it a bit fuzzy as to when him losing control of his Evol nearly killed MC. This passage seems to draw a direct connection between the incident "that night" and the start of the dreams ("blood [...] dripping into his dreams").
	* Technically, [[MC]]'s whereabouts before the experiments in 2034 were unknown, so it's possible he did meet her before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]? But this seems unlikely.
	* Or, he saw her in his dreams before he met her, and he dreamed of becoming a "threat to her"? And then met her during the Catastrophe?
	* #todo look for clues in key Zayne memories

The [[Super Hunters Missions]] article identifies this issue as [[Unstable Evol]].
