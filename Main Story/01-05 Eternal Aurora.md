# Summary

[[MC]] reads [[Josephine's notes]] and finds out that she was a test subject and that the [[Protocore fragment]]s in her heart don't belong to a normal [[Protocore]], but to an [[Aether Core]]. She asks [[Zayne]] for more information, and he suggests visiting [[Dr. Noah]], MC's first cardiologist.

Along the way, [[MC]] and [[Zayne]] run into each other, and learn that [[Wanderer]]s have attacked the [[[Arctic dispatch center]], halting the train schedule. After helping [[Arctic Hunter]]s deal with some [[Wanderer]]s, they borrow a [[SnowDog]] and make it to [[Snowcrest]].

Once there, MC learns a little bit more about her past from [[Dr. Noah]]--especially that the [[Aether Core]] is very appealing to those who are hungry for power, and she should carefully hide the information. He also shares that the only former researcher known to still be alive has joined [[Onychinus]].

[[MC]] and [[Zayne]] watch the aurora together, and [[Zayne]] shares that a friend of his died in "an accident" on [[Mt Eternal]] during the [[Mt Eternal incident]]. The next morning, they part ways--MC heading back to [[Linkon]] to continue her investigation, and [[Zayne]] heading into [[Mt Eternal]] for undisclosed reasons.
