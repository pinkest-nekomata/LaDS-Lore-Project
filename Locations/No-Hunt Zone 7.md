* Aspects of this may have been exaggerated to scare MC, but the [[Tenebra]]e note is likely true

A forested area with some ruins. Parts are more intact than others. There's an old signal station and a [[Flux Nexus]].

# Spacepedia
Originally a forest surrounding Linkon City, it was chosen as the location for a cosmic signal station. It was one of the places first attacked during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], and the signal station was destroyed. Now, a large number of [[Wanderer]]s live here.
# Other Info

## Traceback II
[[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]] details [[Xavier]] visiting this area before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. The signal station is a secret at that point in time, and the forest is peaceful. Hidden past a dark valley is the crash site of the [[Traceback II]].
* Could this actually be [[No-Hunt Zone 19]] from [[Silvery Polyphony]]? #todo
