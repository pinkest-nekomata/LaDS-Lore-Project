# Summary
We meet [[Jenna]] and get more information on the daily life of hunters, such as the [[Hunter's Watch]] (which collects data to assess performance) and the various Sectors that the rookies will be assigned to. (See also [[Hunters Association#Sectors]]) [[Tara]] gets her assignment to [[Data Analysis]], while [[MC]] gets her assignment to [[Alpha Team]].

# Details

After [[Xavier]] leaves, the remaining [[Wanderer]]s are of no higher than A threat level. [[MC]], Tara, [[and]] the other rookies present quickly clear out the remnants, and there's no more danger. Then, they return to [[UNICORNS]].

[[Jenna]] meets the recruits face-to-face for the first time and explains the functions of their [[Hunter's Watch]]es.

Recruits then receive assignments to their res[]()pective Sectors. [[Tara]] is [[Data Analysis]] under [[Andrew]], and MC is [[Alpha Team]] under [[Jenna]].

Then, they head to [[Azure Square]] for a bite to eat. [[Mini drones]] are mentioned patrolling for [[Wanderer]]s. [[Tara]] shares the story of how [[Jenna]] saved her from a Wanderer, and [[MC]] remembers her experience during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] (see that page for more details).

MC decides to go home, but a young boy hiding in the bushes overheard that she was a hunter. He offers trading cards and asks for her help in response, dragging her along.
