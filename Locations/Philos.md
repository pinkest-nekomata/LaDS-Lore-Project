# Spacepedia
The celestial body alpha-P0159 was discovered via the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. It's speculated to be the core of a star. While this core no longer reacts to energy, research suggests that traces of life may very well exist within its galaxy.
Using the most vibrant colors of Deepspace, the galaxy where alpha-P0159 resides responded to humanity's lifelong vision of the universe. This, it was named Philos, a word meaning "love".

# Other Info
The first in-story reference to this celestial body is during [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]]. In the EN localization, there's inconsistency/ambiguity as to whether the body is "a planet" or "the core of a star". Either way, its [[Sterre Energy]] has been depleted.

## Origin
 #todo add/refine citations

In [[Xavier academy anecdote]], we learn that Earth died and was remade as [[Philos]]. Based on [[Xavier]]'s reflections in (citation #todo) where he looks at the sky and wonders if he can see [[Philos]], Earth must have also passed into that star system at the same time. ((What remains unclear is whether there are multiple parallel versions of [[Philos]] or not.))
