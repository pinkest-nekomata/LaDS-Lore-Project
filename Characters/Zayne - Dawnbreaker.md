# Timeline
Unlike [[Xavier]], [[Rafayel]] and [[Sylus]], [[Zayne]] is not unnaturally long-lived. This timeline is "another life" of Zayne's, with presumably a normal lifespan.

[[Still In Dark]] gives us these timing clues:
From [[Still In Dark#02 Mystery]]
> Long before Ivan's generation was born, Wanderers had appeared on Earth. As far back as he can remember, Wanderers roamed the city, prompting people to spend most of their time indoors to avoid them. Many simple tasks were delegated to robots, and people indulged in VR to pass their remaining years.

[[Still In Dark#03 Shelter]]
> The city's outdoors belongs to robots, Wanderers, and weeds.

In the same chapter, Zayne has an old Linkon City Travel Guide. Georgie doesn't recognize the name "Linkon City".
> "Is this book very old? As old as my grandpa? No, it should be even older than that..."

## Commentary
There are a couple of likely scenarios for what's going on with this timeline. Based on the timing clues, it's likely been around 100 years since Wanderers appeared, but there's no guarantee that they appeared in 2034 in this timeline. If they did, this story would take place around 2134--long enough for artifacts of [[Linkon]] to still be around but the city to be unrecognizable, even if it's geographically the same place.

### An alternate future version of Linkon City
Notably, in the main timeline, it's possible that the creation of the [[Hunters Association]] is only possible because of [[Xavier]]'s intervention during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. After all, humanity didn't understand [[Protocore]]s yet, and only Xavier was able to defeat the powerful [[Tezcatlipoca]].

In a world without Xavier's intervention, the dystopia depicted in this timeline would be likely--there's no mention of Hunters, so humanity mostly hides indoors to stay safe from Wanderers and relies on robots for dangerous work. They have some amount of Protocore technology (and exposure to it is causing [[human to Wanderer transformation]]) but it's more limited than in the [[Philos]] timeline. For example, [[Detective Ivan]] refers to Wanderers as being made of "energy" instead of "[[Metaflux]]".

Notably, this timeline does not seem to be on a trajectory towards [[Philos]]--it's moreso on a trajectory to be overrun by [[Wanderer]]s. Given the game's emphasis on [[branching timelines]], I think this is more likely to be an alternate timeline than a future event in the game's main timeline. While it's possible that hunters did exist and were somehow defeated or forgotten, I think this is less likely than it being an alternate consequence of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].
* This leads to some other interesting questions. Is future-[[Philos]] possible at all without [[Xavier]]'s intervention and some kind of time loop? Is this just an interesting "what if" about things going differently? Will we get more clues about what lead to this timeline vs others?

### Less likely possibilities
* This is a Plate on [[Philos]]?
* [[Philos]] ends up being created after this point?
* Wanderers appear before 2034 in this timeline?
