Occurred in late spring/summer of 2043, the year [[Zayne]] became an MD. (See also [[Zayne#Timeline]] and [[Never-Ending Winter]].)

There was a persistent [[Protofield]] anomaly along the northern face of [[Mt Eternal]] that caused the appearance of a neverending stream of [[Wanderer]]s. Only by destroying the center of the [[Protofield]] could the [[Wanderer]]s be stopped. ([[Never-Ending Winter]])
* Zayne continues to investigate this northern side of [[Mt Eternal]], even bringing back a [[snow velvet]] as described in [[WU-09 No Morning]].

[[Zayne]] was called to the [[Arctic]] with [[Dr. Noah]] and soon joined [[William]]. He started as a surgeon, then became a combat medic with the [[Evol Special Rescue Unit]], then finally fought as a soldier.

Zayne was instrumental in destroying the protofield, but the exposure caused [[William]] to transform into a [[Wanderer]] ([[human to Wanderer transformation]]) and [[Zayne]] was forced to kill him. This was all too similar to [[Zayne's Dawnbreaker dreams]] that have been haunting him.
