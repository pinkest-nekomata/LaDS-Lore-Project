# Summary
[[Rafayel]] denies guilt in [[Raymond]]'s death, but reveals that when his blood is added to the [[coral stone]] it produces ocean-themed illusions.

# Details

[[MC]] confronts [[Rafayel]] about the painting having affected [[Raymond]]. [[Rafayel]] denies any guilt, saying he's a victim in this too. As MC goes to leave, he stops her, and says he also wants to know if the [[coral stone]]s are the source of the problem.

He grabs the hand holding the coral stone, and materializes his dagger to cut himself. He lets a drop of blood onto the coral stone, and flames spring forth. Then blue mist forms in a circle, and a little blue fish swims along it. "Illusions," MC says. 

Rafayel: "Well that explains why I started hearing things right after getting a paper cut."
* ((We have reason to believe this is just him being glib and feigning ignorance. For example, his actions in [[01-08 Galactic Sunset]] and [[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures]].))

[[Metaflux]] fluctuations occur right after. A protofield is visible in the background. MC tells [[Rafayel]] to hide and leave it to her, but he insists its his own house and he's going to defend it. He summons fire in his hand, revealing his [[Evol]]. They enter the [[Protofield]].
