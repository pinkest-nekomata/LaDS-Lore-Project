 After fighting the [[Wanderer]], [[Rafayel]] says that if they can't find what he's looking for yet, he'll consider it practice. He's then startled and suddenly fearful--due to a kitten in a tree.

[[MC]] coaxes down the kitten, much to [[Rafayel]]'s chagrin. MC notices that the cat has a [[Metaflux]] injury, so when it runs off, she follows it to investigate.
