> Orson, the [[Linkon City Police Department]]'s infamous repeat offender, is known for [[Protocore]] smuggling. Caught countless times, he's always finding new ways to stir up trouble.

A key character in [[WU-11 Frontline Hunter]].

[[Colin]] has saved his life twice now. Orson is friendly and grateful towards Colin, who is mostly miffed and annoyed.

Key events:

* To thank him for that first time Colin saved his life, Orson gifted him a banner that reads "The Voice of Salvation, a Dispatcher Protecting Life Itself!"
* Orson spent five months in jail for this.
* [[Orson]] calls in a second time now that he's in deep for trying to pass off rock candy as [[Protocore]]s too other smugglers.
* [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] answer the call and save him, after which he's promptly arrested again
