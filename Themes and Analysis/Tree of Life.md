A theme in [[Where Stars Scatter]]. The myths of [[Philos]] speak of a Tree of Life with restorative powers.

It's ultimately revealed that there are two versions of the tree. The "true" version is made of golden energy similar to (or the same as) MC's, and it's what gives her the choice to go back in time and secure a new future for Philos (see [[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 8]]).

By contrast, there's a false "tree of life" that enabled Philos's immortality. Really, it's a tree of death made of corpses.

From [[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 7]]:
> There's a deathly pale wrist encased in crystals.
> Akin to veins, dark red vines are wrapped around a rib cage. The delicate roots of eerie flowers penetrate hollow eye sockets.
> MC: That's...
> Xavier: ...Look over there.
> *In the distance, a twisted "tree" looms.*
> *It isn't a real tree, but one formed by countless crystallized skeletons. They're stacked and entangled with one another.*
> *Their twisted forms are similar, for they step on those beneath them in a futile attempt to reach for something on high.*
> *Thin vines ensnare the crystallized remains. Together, they form a thick, trunk-like structure that's deeply embedded in the planet.*
> MC: That's...
> *A thousand horrified thoughts flood my mind.*
> *This is the Tree of Life... It's a tree made from corpses.*
> I've never seen these people before, yet I recognize their clothing as garments that belong to [[Philos]].
> Each and every one of their expressions are filled with despair and terror. They're like souls in the depths of hell who are seeking salvation.
> MC: Were these Philosians trapped here? Why...
> Xavier: [[Philos]] is an artificial planet.
> *He suddenly speaks.*
> Xavier: Their pretense of eternity depends on an energy source called a "Protocore."
> \[...]
> Xavier: They're the victims who were used as fuel.
