# Summary

They defeat the [[Wanderer]] and emerge back into the Research Center. Xavier reveals the [[Spatium Core]] fragment. MC delivers it to the association while Xavier heads home to recover. She finds him that evening, bringing food and they discuss the mission. A [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] was found at the research lab.

MC presses Xavier for his true theories, and he finally relents, saying that he believes [[Ever]] is the one backing [[Soren]]. He confirms that several traitors from the [[Backtrackers]] are probably working with them, and are also trying to cause problems for Xavier.

# Details
Upon defeating the [[Wanderer]], a rift seems to form, then deposits [[MC]] back in the research center. It's morning now. Xavier is behind her. She briefly sees his [[suppression collar]] activate at his neck, then disappear.

Xavier says he's fine, just a little tired. He offers her a green [[Protocore fragment]]. ((A piece of the [[Spatium Core]].)) He asks her to sit with him and reports that the police (([[Linkon City Police Department]])) and [[Hunters Association]] have been called and are on their way. MC is worried and tries to get up, but he pulls her down next to him, asking her to listen to a song with him. ((This is something they did together in their stolen moments in [[When Shooting Stars Fall]].))

She teases him that they're wireless, so she won't have to lean as close to him. He says he's too tired to drift away--and wouldn't, anyway.

Afterward, MC returns to the Association with the [[Protocore fragment]], while [[Xavier]] heads home to sleep. After settling things with the Association, MC goes to Xavier's apartment to check on him with a bag full of food. They eat together, and she teases him with a warning from [[Jenna]] that if he deliberately puts MC in danger gain, she won't let him off the hook.

MC reports that no traces of [[Soren]] were found during the investigation at [[Prestara University]], and [[Xavier]] concludes that he's long gone. MC reflects, then concludes he must have a larger group behind him to be able to pull these things off.

Xavier pulls out a delivery from Dr. [[Ulysses]]--at the research center, they found a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]], which caused the [[RMFMA]]'s malfunction/corruption and lured in the [[Wanderer]]. MC asks, and Xavier confirms, that such a device could also help with creating the illusion like they experienced. She correctly guesses that when Xavier said only a few people knew how, he meant Philosians--like [[Soren]].

But he's cagey, handing her a stack of evidence documents and prompting her to come to her own conclusion. But she pushes them back, saying she'll read them later, but she wants to know his real opinion now.

After hesitating, he confirms that it's [[Ever]]. MC adds that the [[Backtrackers]] are involved and are trying to cause trouble for him, and he confirms. She feels like he's finally let her into his heart a little bit, and they're standing on the same side.
