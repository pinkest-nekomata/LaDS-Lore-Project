Dr. [[Zayne]] in the main timeline started having dreams of a "[[Grim Reaper]]" (see also [[Zayne's death theme]]) when he was twelve ([[Never-Ending Winter]]). Reciprocally, [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] started having dreams of Dr. Zayne when he was twelve ([[Still In Dark]]).

# Dream contents

From [[Never-Ending Winter#01 Night's Daytime Brightness]]
> All Zayne sees is a world of ice and snow. He steps over dozens of bodies, blood still dripping from his hands. With a wave, dark crystals pierce through several other still struggling.
> There are no screams. It's so quiet that only the sound of his own footsteps can be heard. There is only a shivering little boy. Zayne stands before him, his shadow looming across the boy's blood-covered face.
> Afraid, the boy is silent. He can only look up at Zayne with wide, shining eyes.
> After a moment of silence, the wind rises. Zayne raises his hand, dark crystals once again forming on his palm--

From [[Never-Ending Winter#02 Deathly Encounter]]
> Zayne is once again in that world of ice and snow.
> But this time, a white figure stands in place of the corpses and blood. Under the raging blizzard, Zayne walks toward him, dark crystals forming on his hands once more. The figure doesn't move. It's waiting to die.
> The moment the crystals soar, the wind stops. In that split second, Zayne sees the other mann.
> It's him in a white coat.

From [[Never-Ending Winter#04 Through Troubled Times]]
> "Years ago," he says after a long time, "I almost killed someone important."
> William is surprised. "What happened?"
> Holding the ice-cold air with his right hand, Zayne lets it go.
> "I lost control of my Evol."
>
> That night, the blood in his hands kept dripping onto the ground, dripping into his dreams. The summer when he was 12 was extraordinarily long. Every little thing--like the ivy climbing up the courtyard wall, the stall that sells popsicles, the swings in the park--is clear in his mind, as if it were yesterday.
> A snowstorm ended that summer.
> It was the first time a black-robed [[Grim Reaper]] appeared in his dreams.

From [[Never-Ending Winter#06 The Nightmare Worsens]] -- a vision moreso than a dream, which occurs after he's forced to kill [[William]] after the [[human to Wanderer transformation]].
> The people he killed in his dreams appear once more. Body after body sprawled in front of him, turning the valley into a giant tomb.
> The wind reverberates into a mournful howl, sounding like a sorrowful cry from the sky or the cries and wails of countless people on the verge of death. Warm, sticky blood gurgles, melting the crystalized snow, which quickly freezes again. It melts and freezes over and over, turning into a tombstone. Zayne watches one of these winding trails of blood. His blood.
> 
> He looks up. The [[Grim Reaper]] stands in the distance, watching him on the snowy mountain covered in blood and death.
