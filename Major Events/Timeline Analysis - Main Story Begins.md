The main story most likely begins in July of 2048. This page goes through the supporting evidence for this conclusion.

[[Zayne#Timeline]] is our primary source for this analysis, since his anecdotes have more specific dates than others.

* In [[01-01.08 Doctor]], MC mentions that she and Zayne first reconnected during a medical check-up "half a year ago".
* In [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs#02 Yesterday Once More]], it's specifically the first year of January 2048.
	* In [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs#05 Snow Depth]], Zayne reviews [[Dr. Noah]]'s medical records now that Dr. Noah has retired, and he sees [[MC]]'s name. So, they haven't yet reconnected at this point, but likely do very soon.

So, if MC and Zayne reconnect in January 2048, then "half a year" later would be July 2048. Several other pieces of evidence support this:
* [[Skyline]] describes [[MC]] cramming for the [[Hunter Exam]] as graduation approaches, implying that the exam is aligned with the school year and if she passes she'll be able to start as a hunter.
* At the start of the main story ([[01-01.01 Deepspace Hunter]]) MC is a new recruit who's recently passed the exam. Since there's not much of a reason for a delay, and it would be common for the [[Hunters Association]] to plan new cohorts for right after the exam/graduation, this puts the start of the main story as most likely being June/July 2048, with July being slightly more likely per the note above.
* Since [[WU-04 From The Stars]] indicates that the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] happened in the summer, and the [[Hunters Association]] President indicates it's been 14 years since the catastrophe, it's fitting that this summer is the 14th year anniversary.

For these reasons, there's a high degree of confidence that the main story is intended to begin in July 2048.
