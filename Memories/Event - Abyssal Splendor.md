As with the other myth events, the key elements of the event are an "exploration" with little mini-scene unlocks and three story chapters. There was also a themed call for this one, and the transcript is below.
# Gem Investigation

## Text Message
[Full text here](https://lads.wiki/wiki/Mysterious_Gem_(Sylus_Text_Message)/Script).

MC shares the "Legendary Gem 'Mark of the Abyss'" article with Sylus. ([Article text here](https://lads.wiki/wiki/Legendary_Gem_%22Mark_of_the_Abyss%22_(Article)), see also [[Mark of the Abyss]])

The conversation reveals that Sylus bought the gem at auction and is having it delivered to the N109 zone. He invites MC over to see it. She jokes about robbing him.

MC arrives at Sylus's base in the evening, excited to see the "cursed gem" everyone's been talking about.

Sylus offers MC an ornate silver knife, and she jumps over a box to brandish it at his throat. He seems unperturbed. ((This is a reference to [[Beyond Cloudfall]].)) She asks about the gem, and he says he lost it. Specifically, the delivery vehicle was destroyed by [[Wanderer]]s, the escorts were unconscious, and the gem was nowhere to be found.

MC asks if he'll be looking for it, and he confirms. He leads her over to the window.
> See that light in the southwest area? That's [[Charon]], the N109's largest trading hub. Everything from trinkets to intel is bought and sold there.

MC invites herself along to investigate.
## Chapter 2

There were no signs of the gem in the east district, but MC did get a lot of trinkets:
> MC: A mini smart scope, band-aid-shaped sensors... And they even come in waterproof and daily-use versions. How considerate!
> Sylus: I've never seen anyone go souvenir shopping in N109 before.
* ((This is also a reference to [[Sorceress MC]] getting trinkets in [[Tarus]] in [[Beyond Cloudfall]].))

She also shows off a brooch that was supposed to mimic a Wanderer's grown, but Sylus comments it has explosives.

MC gives Sylus a hard time for scaring people off when she tries to get intel from them. She pokes his cheeks to make him smile.

## Chapter 3

[[Mephisto]] ends up finding the gem in the nest of some other crows. However, it's now broken in two. MC says it's a shame for the story to end there. Sylus suggests she continue the story, and his words have a double meaning:
> Sylus: For example, let's say the gem was tired of power struggles and bloodshed. With the help of a certain hunter, it... It's living a life of peace it never knew before.
> MC: Now that's a refreshing plot twist. But I have an even better idea.
> *I pull out a pair of bracelets from the N109 "souvenirs" I got.*
> MC: I was thinking how these bracelets were a tad bare and plain. They could surely use some embellishment. How about we each wear half a gem on our bracelets? Symbolic, wouldn't you say?
> Sylus: Hold on, this rock represents an ill omen and curse, remember? Aren't you afraid of wearing it?
> *Still, Sylus takes the bracelets and the gem pieces, his palm momentarily flashing with a dark glint. The gem pieces seamlessly embed themselves into the bracelets.*
> MC: Even better. We share a curse now with these halves, live together and die together. You'd better think it through beforehand. Once you put on this bracelet, you're stuck with me for good.
> Sylus: `(chuckles)` Living and dying by your side doesn't sound like a bad curse.
> *A strong wind whips around us as the night sky envelopes everything. Sylus secures the bracelet on his wrist and gazes up.*
> *The depth of his eyes, just like the gem, reveals a surprising mix of vulnerability and affection.*
> Sylus: If this truly means we will never be separated... This "curse," perhaps, is an oath belonging to a fiend, binding us together in life and death.

Transcript:
Hunting is a sport that tests your strategies.

The people who are more patient and possess a stronger desire to win will come out on top.

But with you... Heh, hunting is a game, a match in every sense of the word.

You barge into my world without care and claim my territory as your own... You are unlike any prey I've ever known.

Or perhaps you're better than the average hunter. You used yourself as bait to disrupt my plans. You even made me do things I would've never done before.

Am I admitting defeat? What did I say that gave you that impression?

Be patient, sweetie. This is only the beginning of our hunt. Time will tell who emerges victorious.

Did the crow become more like a dove? Or did a peaceful dove transform into a bird of prey?

I'm looking forward to the outcome of this match.
