In a charming meta-narrative, the character [[Sawyer]] works QA for an immersive VR version of Linkon City.

# Summary
Quality Assurance professionals [[Sawyer]] and [[Aubrey]] work on testing the upcoming game Linkon Online, which is meant to be an immersive VR experience mimicking life in Linkon City perfectly. In testing the game, they find themselves unable to always be confident in what's reality vs. what's the immersive simulator.

The narrative is very meta, including winks at the development of LaDS itself, as well as a little twist at the end that brings question to whether [[Sawyer]] and [[Aubrey]] were ever in Linkon or if they were always within the simulation... (Which is intended to bring the reader's attention to the fact that they were fictional characters within a game the whole time)

There's not much lore here (if any) but it's a charming story.

# 01 Optimization Log
Patch notes for the in-universe game [[Linkon Online]].

# 02 Virtuality
Introduces [[Sawyer]] and [[Aubrey]] as characters and Linkon Online as an immersive VR game, which sometimes leaves them a little uncertain which is the real world (or, at least, they joke about it).

# 03 The Noodle Revolution
[[Sawyer]] reflects on how his real-world experience of becoming a regular at a noodle cart inspired feedback that made the game better--NPCs now learn from players over time, remembering common orders and things like that. It makes the game much more immersive.

# 04 The Old Tale
[[Sawyer]] and [[Aubrey]] have a very meta conversation about imagining if the world they lived in was really a video game, and things like the Wanderers showing up were just "a new season's content" or "a bug" and they rolled out hunters to fix that big. They are, of course, literally characters in a video game where developers create all the problems and define how the characters relate to them, so it's a cute little meta-moment.

The story ends with a little recursive moment, where the avatars in the VR world have the exact same conversation as the one that [[Sawyer]] and [[Aubrey]] had to start the anecdote, leading the reader to question if they were in a simulation the whole time... (And, in fact, they were--it's all a game within a game within a game.)
