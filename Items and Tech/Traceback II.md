# Journey to Earth
The long journey took them through many unfamiliar galaxies, through peaceful cosmic white noise and harrowing turbulence. The journey felt endless, though they passed much of it in hibernation pods. ([[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]]).

There was a mistake in their destination. ([[01-08.07 Stellar Guidance]])

# Crash site
The ship crashed on Earth in a forest. Part of the wreckage is underground. ([[WU-04 From The Stars]])

Eventually, [[Linkon]] City was built nearby, as was a secret signal station, but the ship remained hidden. After the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], the area became [[No-Hunt Zone 7]], which features heavily in the main story chapter [[01-03 Talented Hunter]]. ((The descriptions of the no-hunt zone and of the forest in [[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]] clearly parallel one another, especially the signal station.))
