> **Summary**
> The Wanderers that assaulted mankind on a massive scale back in 2034 all carried two pairs of sword-looking weapons. They were able to travel from one place to another through mirrors and attack people out of the blue. Fast and powerful, they are thought to be one of the most dangerous types of Wanderers.
> They brought about mass casualties and caused severe damage to buildings all across [[Linkon]] City, and managed to escape mankind's sieges on more occasions than one by traveling through mirrors. The public was crippled by unprecedented panic when they wiped out an elite squad, but [[Lumiere]] eventually eliminated all of them.
> **Sightings**
> Note: The list is an incomplete sighting frecord of [[Lumiere]] that counts only sightings with eyewitnesses and video recordings.
