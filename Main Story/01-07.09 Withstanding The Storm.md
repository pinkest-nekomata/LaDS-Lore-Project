# Summary

[[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] follow the frightened cat, which ends up lashing out at [[Rafayel]] and drawing his blood. This finally summons the [[Deluge Wyrmlord]], and combat begins.

# Details
[[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] approach the cat to try to help it. MC reaches out, but Rafayel stops her--and the startled cat scratches his hand instead of MC's.

The cat runs off and then the sky darkens. There are strong winds, and something comes from the deep. A massive waterspout forms in the ocean, and a [[Deluge Wyrmlord]] (a plesiosaur-like [[Wanderer]]) emerges.

It sends a wave over the shore, and [[Rafayel]] protects himself and [[MC]] with a shield of fire that evaporates the water. He doesn't seem surprised to see the Wyrmlord.

MC notes that [[Rafayel]]'s flames split the waters. ((This could be a hint at Rafayel's identity as the [[Sea God]].))

> Rafayel: Guess you like my blood a lot more, huh? Sorry to break it to you, but my fire can never be extinguished.

As confirmed in [[01-07.10 Battle - Abyssal Torrent]], the cat scratching [[Rafayel]] released his blood, and that's what drew in the Wyrmlord. The description of that battle hints at the secret power of  of [[Rafayel]]'s [[Sea God]] blood.
