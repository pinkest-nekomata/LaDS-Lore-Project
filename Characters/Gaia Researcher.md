This former colleague of [[Grandma]] (Josephine) caused the crash of the [[Protocore]] transport vehicle in [[05-01.01 New Objective]].

She's depicted as a silhouette with long hair, and her name is not yet known.
* ((Given that she's not described as elderly or older, unlike the other researchers, it's possible she has access to anti-aging, though this is pure speculation at this point.))
