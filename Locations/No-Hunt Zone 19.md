Mentioned in [[Silvery Polyphony]].
Depicted as a forested area with deciduous trees.

It contains an old giant metal signal tower with bulletproof glass. It's continued to operate even since the area was designated a [[No-Hunt Zone]], picking up signals from outer space. It converts electromagnetic waves into auditory signals, producing an unsettling hum. [[Xavier]] knows how to operate the machinery.

In [[Silvery Polyphony]], something about the signals seems to be attracting [[Wanderer]]s to the area. [[Xavier]] teleports to the interior of the tower, meaning he's been there before.
