# Spacepedia
Eccentric, rule-breaking twins who enjoy playing pranks. They often wear masks that conceal their faces, so it's difficult to tell the two apart. However, upon closer inspection, one can discern the vivacious and unpredictable nature of the older brother, Luke. This contrasts with the comparatively calm and dependable personality of his younger brother, Kieran.

# Name localization

It's a bit of a stretch in the EN localization, since the names are of different origins but it holds true:
* Luke is derived from the latin Lucas meaning "light" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_(given_name)))
* Kieran is the anglicized version of an Irish name meaning "little dark one" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciarán))

The wordplay in the CN localization is more clear, and even rhyme with each other: Xuē Míng & Xuē Yǐng (薛明＆薛影) ([Fandom wiki](https://loveanddeepspace.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_and_Kieran))
* Ming (明) means "bright, light, clear" ([Behind the Name](https://www.behindthename.com/name/ming))
* Ying (影) means "image, shadow" ([Behind the Name](https://www.behindthename.com/name/ying))

# Other Info
Due to [[Ever]]'s experimentation, the twins are able to share what they see with each other, speak to each other telepathically, and feel the other's pain.

## Differences
Luke likes to chew ice and has a thrill for the cold. Kieran has a hobby of making darts, and even learned how to incorporate [[Protocore]]s into them. ([[WU-10 Mischief#03 Trick]])

One of the twins has scars on his face and body from his transformation, and [[WU-10 Mischief]] is careful to not say which twin. However, given the dialogue and thematic choices, it's most likely Kieran that's the one with the scars. (See also [[WU-10 Mischief#Commentary]])
* ((It's not consequential, but I wanted to pick a twin for fanfic purposes.))

## Backstory

When the Main Story begins, they're 18. Sylus took them in two years prior, when they were 16 ([[WU-10 Mischief]]).

[[WU-10 Mischief]] provides additional context on their backstory:
* They're genetically identical (monozygotic) twins
* They grew up on the streets, then were kidnapped by [[Ever]]
* There, twin experiments gave them mind link powers. They can see what the other sees, and also feel the pain the other feels.
* There was an "incompatibility" reaction, causing them to be at risk of "transforming"
	* [[human to Wanderer transformation]]
	* [[black crystals]]
* They escape, and decide to go out with a bang, trying to kill [[Sylus]]
* He ends up taking them in, and helping keep the transformation at bay

# Experiment Records
From [[WU-10 Mischief#01 Rule No. 1]]

> **Monozygotic Twin Comparative Test Record**
> **Subject ID:** 808
> **Subject Names:** Luke, Kieran
> **Age:** 16
> **Experiment Side Effect(s) Log**
> Subjects manually influence each other's visual, pain, and auditory senses. Here are examples of this phenomenon:
> 1. The subject Luke can see images within Kieran's field of vision, and vice versa.
> 2. The subjects Luke and Kieran can experience the same level of pain at the same time.
> 3. ...
> **Evaluation Results**
> After the [[Protocore]] exposure, both subjects show rejection reactions. A transformation occurring within three months is highly possible.
> Comprehensive risk assessment far exceeds standard values. Subjects are to be transferred to the disposal site for termination.
> **Notes**
> The disposal site is adjacent to the [[N109 Zone]]. Researchers must complete the Firearms Request Form and collect weapons for self-defense before leaving.
