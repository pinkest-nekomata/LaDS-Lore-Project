# 02 Birthday
Still dressed up from the interview, [[Thomas]] is at a lively market. The produce vendor recognizes him, mentioning that [[Solana]] (Thomas's wife) visited earlier and guessing if they were dressed up for Thomas's birthday.

Thomas's musings reveal that [[Rafayel]] was meant to be the interviewee, but when he didn't show, there was a quick pivot. The crew invited him out for dinner, but he had plans to celebrate with [[Solana]], so when he left they give him the shrimp gift box intended for [[Rafayel]]. He was at the produce stand to get garlic to make garlic shrimp for her.

Back at home, [[Thomas]] is attentive and diligent as a father, mixing formula and starting on making the garlic shrimp for [[Solana]]. Work calls interrupt throughout. It's revealed he loves the popular romance drama, "[[Let's Watch the Meteor Shower]]".

Just when they get a quiet moment, [[Rafayel]] calls. [[Thomas]] hurries out to meet him--but [[Rafayel]] and [[MC]] surprise him at the elevator with a gift and birthday wishes. Then they leave again, arm in arm, telling him to enjoy celebrating with his family.
