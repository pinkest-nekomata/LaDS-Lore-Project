[[Xavier]]'s [[Evol]] power is limited by a neck suppression collar. He first got this collar in [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], after defying his controlling family in an effort to help [[Academy MC]].

The [[Hunters Association]] was able to at least increase the threshold, but [[Xavier]]'s full power level is still limited.

[[03-C Voyage of the Outcast - 10]] hints that MC's power, especially with the [[Aether Core]], can temporarily override this limit.
