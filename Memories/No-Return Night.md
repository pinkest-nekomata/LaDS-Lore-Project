# Summary
MC meets Caleb at the [[Farspace Fleet command center]] to pick him up and head to a restaurant he frequented in his college days for his birthday dinner. (This is the same as mentioned in [[Event - Summer Daydream#Chapter 2]], where he missed his birthday reservation with MC due to a mission.) At the restaurant, they chatter and reminisce. MC plays dumb as she preps another holographic surprise--branches laden with Asiatic apples and blooms appear around them. She presents his cake, and they go through their usual birthday ritual. They leave the restaurant at sunset, then take off in Caleb's personal aircraft, heading towards [[Newts Island]] and the special movie theater there. MC reveals she got the idea from a middle school newspaper where Caleb said it was a birthday wish to see a movie in the sky. 

As they watch the movie from Caleb's childhood, Caleb reflects that he used to want to fly so he could see the world. Now that he realizes there's no real destination because there's always somewhere else to go, the continued motion and endless flights feel like a burden. MC reflects that maybe he likes the movie because it's about rest and spending time with the people you care about.

Back at [[Caleb's place]], he watches a birthday video [[MC]] and [[Caleb]]'s friends recorded for him several years ago. MC talks about how she wants this year to be different, and her feelings are different. She confesses that she's taken him for granted, and she cares about him. Afterward, they each head to their room. Unable to sleep, MC hears Caleb up and heads down with a tin of candy as his "gift". She goes to give it to him, then leave again, but he pulls her back. She gives him a lemon candy, and when he complains it's sour, she tells him he can give it to her if he doesn't like it (i.e., kiss her). Things escalate, with MC returning his assertiveness.

In the same narrative style as the [[Banner - Nightly Rendezvous]] memories, it's strongly implied that MC and Caleb then sleep together.


# Key Info

* Caleb likes his drink with 3x the lemon juice.
* The restaurant manager recognizes Caleb and reports that a few years ago, his buddies had a birthday dinner for him where he couldn't make it, but they used the restaurant's equipment to make a life-sized hologram of him.
	* This is the same absence referenced in [[Event - Summer Daydream#Chapter 2]]
	* Caleb playfully "accuses" MC of having something to do with it. She claims she was just going along with it.
* The movie they see is [[A Day with My Pilot, Ta-ta]]
	* It's over a decade old. 
	* 30% of the reviews are negative. 
	* Caleb has watched the movie many times.
	* It's a very long story where monotonous, repetitive scenes are paired with cryptic background music to a sleep-inducing degree.

# Quotes

When MC notes his increased chest circumference:
> Caleb: Eyes on the road.

> MC: Has your shift officially ended, Colonel?
> Caleb: I've been temporarily released from my duties for eighteen hours.
> MC: You made it sound like working for the Fleet is equivalent to being in prison...
> Caleb: Not really. Prisoners can get their sentences reduced. These Fleet problems just keep piling up. And there's no end in sight.

> Caleb: Okay, that's enough. It's my birthday. I'll be jealous if you pay attention to anyone else.
> MC: ...Really?
> *He leans closer to my ear, and his voice is unexpectedly gentle.*
> Caleb: I was joking. I'm *always* like that.

> Caleb: Okay, I'll tell you. I'm happy that I *finally* get to enjoy the cake you made for me without having to share it.

Referring to long flights:
> Caleb: I miss the most ordinary, uneventful moments of daily life during those times.

> MC: Before... I took you for granted. You were like the sun. And the Sun is just in the sky, always shining. It's a part of my life, so I assumed it'd always be there.

> MC: Even if you're a dim white dwarf, a supernova, or a bunch of ruins... I wouldn't care.

> Caleb: Lavender... Time and time again, you've always allowed me to want more than what I thought was possible.
> *The cushion falls to the floor. My breath hitches, and I'm pulled into an embrace so warm that it almost burns.*
> *But can a single embrace really bridge the 150 million kilometers between the Sun and the Earth? Will it be enough to make him mine?*

> *I want to keep touching him. I want us to descend into the depths of our feelings. I want more... I... want him.*

> Caleb: I know that's not your gift. I'll twist your words on purpose and use them to catch you

> Caleb: I wish we'll always fly under the same sky and be in each

other's lives.
