# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] successfully deal with the [[Wanderer]]--but [[Xavier]]'s brute force approach resulted in all the windows of the train and station being shattered. [[MC]] feels bad about the damage, and [[Xavier]] admits to having been exhausted--then promptly dozes off again while standing.

# Details

[[MC]] leaves the train with the [[Tezcatlipoca]]'s [[Protocore]] in-hand. It's spherical, with a translucent shell and a purple core within. MC wonders if the apperance of the [[Tezcatlipoca]] has anything to do with the [[Flux Nexus]] they found in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]].

MC and Xavier notice with regret that all the windows on the train and in the station are shattered. Xavier admits to using a brute force approach because he was exhausted. He's already dozing off again.

## Commentary
Later, we'll learn that [[Xavier]] needs to sleep to recover his energy, along with a medication from [[Philos]]. (citation #todo) His initial sleepiness indicates that he's been straining himself and is still recovering, so he was already exhausted going into the fight.
