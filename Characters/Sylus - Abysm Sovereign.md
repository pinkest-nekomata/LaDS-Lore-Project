# Quotes
> MC: You have no intention of disguising yourself?
> Sylus: No need. No one would believe a fiend would wander around a market. Besides, everyone sees a fiend differently--some see ugliness, others see horror, cruelty... What they see isn't me. They only see their own hearts.
> -- [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 4]]

> I smell a floral fragrance. Is this the scent of his soul that carries a faint, scorching bitterness?

# Backstory

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 1]]
 >The wind howls through the crimson valley as countless soldiers of the legion of Justitia thrust their weapons at my chest.
> I quickly realize this isn't my past, and the body writing in pain isn't mine either. This is the dragon's memory.

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 2]]
> Over 1600 years ago, after centuries of war with humanity, the dragon, said in legend to bring about Philos's end, was finally sealed in the Abyss beneath the fiend-infested [[Tarus]] City by the [[Legion of Justitia]].
> The decisive event, known as the "Battle of Tarus", led to widespread praise for the Legion. the leader who drove his sword into the dragon's heart was revered as the "[[Sacred Judicator]]".
> Monuments honoring his deeds stand tall across Philos, and his followers built a grand [[Sanctuary]] in his name after his death.

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 3]]
> Whenever I close my eyes, the sound of howling wind inside the cave sends me back to that blood-red valley. All I can hear is a dragon's cries.
> The moment those blades pierce his chest, the same pain and fury also run through me.

> He falls into the valley as soldiers from the [[Legion of Justitia]] thrust their weapons into his chest.
> He slides down, and sharp rocks tear into his flesh. A dragon's roar fills the valley, then slowly fades into silence.
> But at the bottom of the valley, it's not a dragon lying there. It's a young man, barely clinging to life.

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 5]]
> Sylus: In the beginning, the dragon lived in a valley with other dragons. Amongst his kin, he was the only one with a human appearance. He mistakenly believed he was a normal person. But as he grew older, horns sprouted from his head and a tail from his back. He had never seen anything like this on someone before. He was scared, so he picked up a blade because he wanted to remove them. But the horns and scales would grow back, dripping with blood. It didn't matter how many times he cut them.
> *He turns and walks onto a small path. There are fewer people here. His voice softens as if he's actually lulling her to sleep.*
> Sylus: After a long time, he finally came to terms with being a monster with horns. But then, the love of his life appeared.
> *The moment she pulled out her sword, he knew she was the one destined to kill him... She was his archnemesis. But somewhere along the way, he stopped wanting to consume her soul.*
> Sylus: She showed him human love and companionship, making him think he could live like a human too. And slowly, without realizing it, he began to forget he was a dragon.
> *Maybe it was the first time she climbed to the cave's opening, and the morning light touched her dirty, scraped face. Or maybe it was her unchecked, ever-growing desire that reminded him of his old self. Or perhaps, deep down, she's also a little monster with horns of her own.*
> Sylus: Yet a monster can never truly become a human. He cannot escape his fate as a dragon, nor can he love anyone for long. Dragons have an inherent tendency to toy with human desire. But in the end, they inevitably become enslaved by it and turn into true monsters... At the end of the story, he killed his beloved. This is the dragon's curse.


From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 8]]
> Sylus: Before I was sealed away, I did dream of you. I just didn't expect I'd be willing to dry that person's hair one day.

# Madness
There are parallels between the madness of the dragon's curse and these concepts in Xianxia fiction. See also [[cultivation]]. The madness isn't necessarily meant to be Qi Deviation, but the context of the tropes is helpful.

From [ImmortalMountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/glossary/wuxia-xianxia-xuanhuan-terms/)'s [[Xianxia]] glossary:
> **Internal Demons** (心魔 xīnmó) – literally translates as “Heart Devils”. Rather than standard demons or devils, these are a practitioner’s negative emotions and other mental barriers which hinder their training/cultivation. Internal Demons, in some cases, can even attack the practitioner from the inside, and failure to adequately resist them may result in Qi Deviation.
> 
> **Qi Deviation** (走火入魔 zǒuhuǒ rùmó) – also known as [Qigong Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zou_huo_ru_mo). Literally translates as “to catch fire and be entered [possessed] by devils”. A state wherein the cultivation base becomes dangerously unstable, causing internal damage to the body and symptoms of psychosis. People who succumb to their Internal Demons, who practice cultivation/martial arts incorrectly, or who rashly use forbidden arts are all at risk of falling into this state.
