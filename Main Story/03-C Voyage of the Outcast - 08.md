# Summary
[[MC]] is now in a modified [[Protofield]] of [[Starfall Forest]]. He hears some of [[Xavier]]'s lines from [[Shooting Stars]], then follows meteors to find him near [[Skymirror Salt Flat]]. There, [[Xavier]] is confronting an apparition of [[Soren]].

[[Soren]] reveals that he poured his life's work into the [[Traceback II]] mission, and now feels betrayed. [[Xavier]] fights him, and injuring the apparition does have an effect. As [[Xavier]] gets increasingly chaotic and out of control, an illusion of [[MC]] appears on the lake. MC takes the chance to shoot [[Soren]], banishing the apparition, but Xavier is still headed towards the center of the lake as if under a spell.

She goes to stop him, and he talks about how if a planet uses ... to survive, then it doesn't deserve to be saved. (i.e., if it requires the repeated sacrifice of [[MC]], as revealed in [[Shooting Stars]].) She resonates with him to try to control his Evol, but it's revealed that the forest is devouring his power. He's glad it chose him this time. ((Compare to the story of a forest that eats people he tells in [[01-03.03 Reunion Under Moon]]))

MC realizes that her [[Aether Core]] power might be able to satisfy the forest, and pours more of her power into the resonance. The forest's hunger stops, leaving them in starry night, and Xavier collapses in her arms.

## Commentary
This chapter has buckets of references to [[Shooting Stars]]. They are mostly recaps, but serve to provide [[MC]] with some clues about [[Xavier]]'s secrets.

Of particular interest is the reveal that the [[Skymirror Salt Flat]] is in [[Starfall Forest]]. Xavier's later comment that the place is based on his memories confirms that the layout is accurate. This also means that when [[MC]] dies in [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], she's instinctively drawn there and the planet may have been draining her power there.

# Details

> *Nebulae tranquilly hang int he sky as if they're the eyes of the universe. Faint rays of light spill over the shadows of trees that sway like waves.*
> MC: (This feels like... a [[Protofield]].)
> *Countless waves of both strong and subtle forces swirl through my heart. I stand in this unfamiliar forest enveloped in thick fog.*
> MC: (This definitely isn't a regular Protofield... the energy here is erratic, and the [[fluctuation]]s are violent.)

MC starts to look for [[Xavier]] and sees a meteor flying across the sky. More fall, all headed toward one side of the forest.
* ((Notably, this is [[Starfall Forest]]. Meteors are also shooting stars, which is a recurring theme for [[Xavier]] and MC, especially in [[When Shooting Stars Fall]] (Anecdote) and [[Shooting Stars]] (Myth)))

MC sprints forward, the meteors guiding her way.
> ??? ([[Xavier - Lightseeker]]): \<Player name>? Is that you?
> MC: (This voice... Xavier!)
> ??? ([[Xavier - Lightseeker]]): Answer me... Where are you...
* ((This is from [[Shooting Stars]], [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/XO9qTMvnts0?si=GBXIYIePQCHNfSjN&t=1970)))

> *Even though I can clearly hear Xavier's voice, I don't know where it's coming from. Is it in front of me? Or... is it echoing from the depths of my heart?*

Chaotic energy surges, making her worry for Xavier. She continues on and eventually finds a mirror-like lake. ((Compare to [[Skymirror Salt Flat]])) As she nears the lake, the [[fluctuation]]s get so strong that she struggles to breathe and sinks to her knees.

She hears [[Xavier]] nearby telling someone to come out, and then [[Soren]] appears in front of him.
> Soren: We're old friends at the end of the day, right? But you decided to greet me with a sword. That's cruel. \[...] You haven't changed even after all these years. You're still afraid of [[Starfall Forest]].
> Xavier: As if you're any different. To you, the ends always justify the means.
> Soren: What are you trying to say? You have no right to criticize me! \[...] I used my life's work on you. I did everything I could to help you pass through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. And what did I get in return? I was abandoned, trampled on, and turned into an outcast in this time and space!
> Xavier: Those were the "rewards" for your choices.

Xavier descends on Soren with his lightblades, but Soren only says that "killing an apparition is a waste of time."
> Xavier: Then why did you dodge?

He slices the apparition in half. MC realizes that it had an effect on the actual [[Soren]]. MC tries to rush to Xavier, but falls again. She notices that his fighting style is now chaotic and agitated.
> Xavier: It's time to put an end to this charade.
> Soren: Wait, wait... You can kill me. But what about her?
> *A meteor falls into the center of the lake. It awakens a sparkling light that twirls into a vague illusion. The silhouette wears a hunter's uniform. It's hard to make out, yet it's unmistakably familiar...*
> MC: (It's... me?!)
> Xavier: ...!
> MC: (My head... It hurts... But why...?)
> *Yet it's at that moment I realize something. Soren created this illusion to distract Xavier. He's using the lapse in judgement to attack Xavier's mind with his Evol. In any other situation, Xavier would have no difficulty dealing with this type of Evol. But with how chaotic the [[Protofield]] is along with his power...*
> Xavier: ... `(Labored breathing)`
> *Xavier falters, but he slowly regains his footing. When he raises his head, his unfocused eyes resemble a frozen lake--
> They're cold and empty.*
> MC: It can't be her... She's not a sacrifice. I will... put an end to everything.
* ((MC as a "sacrifice" is a direct reference to [[Shooting Stars]]))

MC tries to tell Xavier that the illusion in the lake isn't her. MC shoots Soren, and the bullet makes the apparition stagger then dissipate. The [[fluctuation]]s calm down. Still, [[Xavier]] heads toward the center of the lake, as if under a spell.

MC rushes after him.

The kindled scene for this branch starts here. ([[Outcast's Voyage]])

> Xavier: A planet that uses... to survive... doesn't deserve to be saved.
> `MC grabs his shoulders and shakes him.`
> MC: Come back to reality, Xavier! Don't lose yourself in the illusion! `(Holds his face)` Look! I'm right here.
> Xavier: `(Gaze focusing)` You are... \<Player name>?
> `Xavier collapses against MC, breathing heavily`
> MC: What's wrong? Are you hurt?
> Xavier: You can't stay here... Run... Otherwise, you'll... as well...!
> MC: (His power is fading... Is this space trying to consume him?)
> `MC resonates with him. He shakes and breathes heavily.`
> MC: What's going on? Why can't I control your Evol?
> Xavier: `(Puts his hand on hers)` It's okay. Starfall forest... will stop once it has enough power... It will... I couldn't... I didn't protect you before. At least... It chose me this time...
> MC: "Enough power"? In that case... The Aether Core's power should satisfy it!
> `MC puts her hand on his chest and resonates.`
> Xavier: No...!
> `Light swirls around them, then the screen goes white. They return to the forest at night, with stars overhead. MC leans against his chest, then returns upright.`
> MC: ...Xavier?
> Xavier: You... You really are... Reckless...
> `Xavier collapses against her again.`
