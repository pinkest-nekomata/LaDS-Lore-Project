[[Xavier]]'s branch in [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] to locate a [[Spatium Core]] fragment.

# Summary
A [[Wanderer]] with a [[Beta-Protocurve]] attacked a group of five freshmen at [[Prestara University]], so MC and Xavier go undercover as students. Xavier appears in his [[Xavier - Distant Youth]] outfit. At first there's no clear connection to the attacks, until they meet up with [[Xavier]]'s old friend, Dr. [[Ulysses]], who reveals that the university has an [[RMFMA]] that might have picked up traces of the [[Wanderer]].

The device's data has been tampered with, but they learn that the five students that were attacked were on a lab tour with a sixth student--[[Soren]], the student council Vice President who supposedly was cooperating with the investigation. It's revealed that [[Soren]] is one of the [[Backtrackers]] that betrayed [[Xavier]] when he teleports to the [[RMFMA]] before Xavier and MC.

There, he summons a [[Protofield]] based on [[Xavier]]'s memories of [[Starfall Forest]], which contains [[Skymirror Salt Flat]], in an attempt to trap him. (See also [[traps for Xavier]].) Snippets of [[Philos]]'s story, including that its core runs on sacrifices, are revealed. Eventually, MC and Xavier defeat [[Soren]]'s apparition and leave the [[Protofield]] via a version of the [[Traceback II]]. They defeat the [[Wanderer]] and gain an [[Aether Core]] fragment soon revealed to be from the [[Spatium Core]]. They also find a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] in the lab, and [[Xavier]] realizes that [[Soren]] has been working with [[Ever]].
