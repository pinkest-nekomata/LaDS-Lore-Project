Images of a ringed planet and a planetary system appear, with the on-Screen text:
> The galaxy which lies asleep shall not be awakened.
> The straightforward pathway has vanished, dissipated like dew.

Bubbles transition into a mournful [[Lemurian]] statue ((cover image for [[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures]])), then a necklace, then a silhouette of [[Rafayel]] underwater.
> Rafayel: Once you go past 30,000 leagues, all is quiet in the deep. There will never be another [[Lemuria]].

Snowflakes transition into [[Zayne]]'s sihouette sitting on a throne surrounded in thorns. A zoomed out shot shoes him surrounded by rubble and a planetary background. He holds a caduceus of ice ((cover image for  [[WU-01 Longly Flame]]))
> Zayne: Imperfect order doesn't need to be corrected. True redemption lies in utter destruction.

Another transition. A white carousel horse's paint peels away, leaving scarred dark grey stone. Xavier holds a sword. A swirling mechanism of suns and moons appears.
> Xavier: Humanity has never abandoned its delusion of the Tower of Babel. Yet they can never reach the top.

Xavier's silhoeutte stands on the mechanism, and a golden crown sits on a pedestal that reads, "If the present world goes astray the cause is in you, in you it is to be sought."

The mechanism swirls. [[Linkon]]'s skyline briefly appears, then the buildings turn to sand in an ornate hourglass. Then the full view of Xavier is revealed, with the crown in the foreground and the horse and hourglass in the background.

> Xavier: As we embark on an irreversible journey let us wield light as our sword to cut down the fallen stars blocking our path.

Likewise, we see the full image of Zayne with the caduceus, surrounded by snowflakes and [[jasmine]].
> Zayne: As the cosmos dances to the tune of eternity, life will reach the fathomless depths of Deepspace.

Rafayel reclines with a paintbrush in his hand and a [[tiny red fish]] swims around him. The statue is revealed to have a scaled fish tail, and a white ring is labeled "The ecliptic."
> Rafayel: The tide is about to rise. And this time, an oath will be sworn with Lemuria's blood. Let's reshape destiny.

Blood drips down the white statue's arm. A droplet falls, becoming clear, and the scene transitions as the drop falls into clear water over a starry expanse.

On-screen text:
> All my straying leads me back to you.


# Commentary
This is mostly hints at information confirmed elsewhere in the game and vibes, but the note about "let's reshape destiny" hints at the [[converging timelines]] and the creation of a new timeline through the in-game events.
