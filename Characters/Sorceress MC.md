# Backstory

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 2]]
> Every year, the [[Sanctuary]] takes in some of the city's orphans in the name of the [[Sacred Judicator]]. It is a place held in even higher regard than the royal palace.
> When these orphans come of age, a [[Judicator's Oracle]], dressed in magnificent robes, takes them away to join the [[Legion of Justitia]].
> However... the [[Judicator's Oracle]] who came to take me threw me into the [[Abyss]] in front of everyone.

 >Arbiter: The Sorceress has been judged! Greed and evil shall perish so long as [[His Majesty]] and the [[Sacred Judicator]] protect [[Philos]] for all eternity!
 
From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 3]]
> Dragon: I've heard you're the princess of Ivory City.
> *I manage a stiff smile.*
> MC: I was supposed to be a weapon to slay dragons. They told me I could kill a dragon--so they filled my head with a lot of things about them. But when they decided to execute me, they said I *was* a dragon. [...] I just broke the rules by keeping a golden lamp with an engraved dragon. Aside from the one in *The Fiend-Slaying God*, no dragons are allowed in the Sanctuary. But I could only talk to that little dragon. And one day, they caught me talking to it.

> The essence of the Ivory City is reflected in its citizens. People dress nicely, exude grace, and possess untainted souls.
> The [[Judicator's Oracle]] says desire is the seed of calamity. Excessive indulgence will allow this disease to grow quietly.
> So, I had to act like everyone else. I needed to abide by proper etiquette, say the right words, and bind my hands and feet with invisible white threads. All of these things turned me into a puppet without a heart.
> But... they still burned my dragon.
> To kill my dragon, they framed me for a great crime. They sentenced a puppet to death because it had one desire.
