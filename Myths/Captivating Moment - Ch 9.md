# Summary
[[Sylus]]'s [[Evol]] controls their fall, and they land on the ground below, [[MC]] in Sylus's arms. As he sets her down, he triggers a detonator--blowing up the entire top floor of the building. It seems he brought a bomb, not goods to trade, though he attempts to brush this off and claim he winged it.

As he offers to help MC with her [[Wanderer]] research, she challenges him--what's his goal now? And she won't believe that it's just because they're 'using' each other. He replies that actions speak louder than words, and "No one should be forced to keep up with someone else". Surprised by his sincerity, MC presses about this 'sudden' change. It's not sudden to Sylus, who says he's working on his own jigsaw puzzle. He won't yet tell her how he sees her--but she keeps him interested in learning more. Together, they head out into the darkness of the night.

## Commentary

### Shifting pretenses
Already the pretense of "using" each other is wearing thin. MC challenges Sylus directly, though he's a bit cagey in his answer--basically, he's saying that his actions will make clear what his goals are. ((It's worth noting that his goals here are to protect her, to spend time with her, to learn more about her. He'll become more confident in voicing these things in time, but he's not wrong that his actions demonstrate these sincere desires.))

### Keeping up with someone else
I'm calling this one out because it's an important moment that I'm not entirely sure how to interpret initially. It's directly in response to MC asking about his goals, and him saying that actions speak louder than words. They're on the topic because of MC's comment about whether any "necessities"--i.e. random explosions--will happen if she lets Sylus help her with the [[Wanderer]] research.

I think what this means is that Sylus isn't intending to hijack her research plans--he'll follow her lead. He doesn't want her to feel like she has to keep up with him, or account for him messing with her plans. Though he asked her to prove herself, he's perhaps saying that he doesn't want or need her to be like him. 

This interpretation is in keeping with MC being surprised at his "sudden" sincerity and willingness to accommodate. It's important to contrast it with MC's perception that Sylus was "pestering" her at first. Now that he's realized it genuinely bothered her, he's much more sensitive about it.

# Details
> During our rapid descent, I can only cling to Sylus.
> The feeling of weightlessness slowly disappears. A red-black mist appears within my line of sight, and it envelops us. Sylus's steady breath is right next to my ear.
> Despite being in a precarious, unpredictable situation, I feel indescribably safe.

They land, MC in Sylus's arms. He tells her to wait there--then pulls out a detonator and hits the button. The top floor of the building explodes, flames shooting into the sky.
* ((Presumably, the briefcase Sylus offered was really a bomb.))

> Sylus: Everything's good now.
> MC: ...
> *Shocked, I gawk at Sylus and step back, but my legs are weak after jumping off the roof. I can't control them.*
> *I stumble and fall onto Sylus.*
> MC: ...I need to rest for a bit.
> *Sylus smiles, reaching out to support me.*
> Sylus: For someone who fell from the rooftop of a building for the first time, you've outperformed most people.
> *I remember the suitcase that was left behind earlier.*
> MC: It wasn't a new type of weapon you took, right... You knew what they were going to do this whole time.
> Sylus: When a product is in high demand and short supply, many buyers will want to become manufacturers themselves. I just winged it.
> MC: I won't buy that.
> Sylus: Since my business finished earlier than expected, you can decide how we'll spend our remaining time together.
> *I warily scrutinize Sylus and notice the hint of mirth in his eyes.*
> MC: You're... not coming up with another scheme, are you?
> Sylus: Do you think I'm that kind of person?
> MC: You just blew up a floor right in front of me.
> Sylus: It was necessary. I wanted to conduct business, yet they insisted on risking their lives.
> *The innocent expression on Sylus's face is weird.*
> MC: I wonder what other "necessities" will occur if you come with me for the research.
> Sylus: There won't be "necessities" if I'm working with you, sweetie.
> *I look at Sylus, who appears calm.*
> MC: What's your goal exactly? Don't give me that "using each other" nonsense. I don't believe it.
> Sylus: Actions speak louder than words.
> *Sylus lowers his head to look at me, his expression more serious than before.*
> Sylus: No one should be forced to keep up with someone else.
> *I meet Sylus's gaze, and my heart races faster than I would've thought possible.*
> MC: Sylus, why are you... acting like this all of a sudden?
> Sylus: It's not sudden. You're not the only one putting together a jigsaw puzzle.
> *Smiling, Sylus gazes at me, the warmth in his eyes reminiscent of a cozy fireplace on a winter day.*
> MC: What kind of person have you pieced together from my jigsaw puzzle?
> Sylus: Well, it's far from complete. But it's enough to keep me interested in finding more pieces.
> *His hand gently grabs my arm, and he guides me into the darkness of the night.*
