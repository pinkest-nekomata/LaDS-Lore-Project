# Details

MC notes that this is the first time she's experienced such a strong [[Evol]] resonance. ((Likely because Xavier's power level is so high.)) They learn that all the [[Protocore]]s were also exploded by the blast.

[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] introduce themselves, and [[Xavier]] asks her to not tell anyone that she saw him that day. He promises to explain the next time they meet.

[[Tara]], having heard the commotion, comes inside. When MC turns back around to tell [Xavier], he's gone (having teleported away).

Tara reveals that after MC went into the warehouse, Tara lost her signal and couldn't contact her. Tara sees the remaining protocore fragments and is seriously impressed that MC took down that many wanderers "by yourself".
