**Description**
> Old Days: With Caleb's first summer vacation in college coming to an end, he was about to return to [[Skyhaven]]. The thought of saying goodbye made me feel a bit melancholic. Noticing this, Caleb suggested we take a walk around the neighborhood.

## Key Info
* The narration specifically refers to "seventeen-or-eighteen year old Caleb"
	* Since he has a June birthday, first summer of college would typically correspond to being eighteen turning nineteen, so he'd be nineteen at the end of summer break if he were a typical age for his year in school
	* The ambiguity of seventeen-or-eighteen, combined with his age being noted as 9-10 in his memory of being experimented on in [[Pathless Realm#05 Arrival]], seems to indicate that in canon his age is uncertain, like MC's
