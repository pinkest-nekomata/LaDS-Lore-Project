# Summary
[[MC]] proceeds to the [[N109 Zone]] to find the triennial [[Zoion Hunt]] in full swing. After almost getting shot and trashing her [[270HM]], she meets a mysterious old man who introduces himself as a "ferryman on the River Styx" ((and is later revealed to be [[Dimitri]])).

He explains the rules of the [[Zoion Hunt]] and the [[ID Camouflage Chip]] that allows him to help her across [[Charon]] without being registered as a hunt participant, then leads her towards the eastern area of the district.

## Commentary

### Charon and the River Styx
Charon is the name of the infamous ferryman of the River Styx in greek mythology, who took coins from dead souls in exchange for taking them across the river that separates the living and the dead. ([[Charon#Namesake]])

[[Dimitri]] essentially refers to himself as Charon here by calling himself the "ferryman", foreshadowing that we'll later learn that he owns the [[Charon]] district (and the secrets under it) and that he's behind the [[Zoion Hunt]]. He's essentially guiding people "from life into death" by running such a deadly game.

### What the "ferryman" knows
We'll later learn that this unnamed man is [[Dimitri]], a researcher from the [[Gaia Research Center]] who worked on MC when she was a child. He already recognizes her at this point. Ultimately, his goal is to coax her to the old [[Gaia Research Center]] to attempt to kill her permanently. ( #todo add reference to later chapter)

# Details
MC proceeds into the [[N109 Zone]] using an [[anti-interference chip]] from [[Sylus]] installed to her [[270HM]].

She initially finds deserted streets and then proceeding closer to an active battle ((the [[Zoion Hunt]] in the [[N109 Zone central district]]. She says it sounds like it's coming from [[Charon]], then details the bloody combat she sees on giant holographic screens above the city.

There's a leaderboard indicating the contestants, and the rapid changes indicate frequent deaths.

[[MC]] intends to talk to [[Philip]] about his connections to [[Grandma]], but [[Sylus]] isn't picking up the phone (and she doesn't know where the [[Odd Workshop]] is) so she tries to head towards the base.

Suddenly, a bullet flies by her and her dodge causes her bike to slide into a corner. She calls it "completely wrecked", but she and Sylus will use it again in [[05-01.05 Join the Game]].

Another bullet comes, but it's blocked by [[Dimitri]], whose name is not yet revealed. He uses his cane to deflect the bullet, then tells her "There are places you shouldn't wander into."

> At my feet, a thin orange-red laser stretches across the street to the buildings on both sides of the street.

[[Dimitri]] indicates that this is the boundary line for the triennial (every three years) [[Zoion Hunt]]'s killing zone.

When she asks who he is, he replies:
> [[Dimitri]]: I'm just a ferryman on the River Styx. I help travelers cross.
* ((See above for more commentary))

He asks if she's looking to "cross Charon's river", and when she accepts his help, he demonstrates an [[ID Camouflage Chip]] which will subvert the surveillance drones. Dimitri tells her that as long as she's within 3 paces of him, it'll mask her data too.
* ((It doesn't seem like he gives her the chip here, but she does end up with it/one later, in the Zayne chapters.))

They head into [[Charon]]'s eastern district.
