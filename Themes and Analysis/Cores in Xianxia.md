"Cores" appear often in CN immortal hero fiction ([[Xianxia]]) and other related genres.

[[Protocore]]s and [[Aether Core]]s directly invoke this trope, so their lore is easier to understand in this context.

From the [ImmortalMountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/glossary/wuxia-xianxia-xuanhuan-terms/) Xianxia glossary:
> Core Formation (结丹 jiēdān) – sometimes left untranslated as “Jiedan”. The stage after Foundation Establishment. It involves forming a Golden Core (金丹 jīndān) by using the Dantian as a crucible and the Cultivation Base as raw material.
> 
> The Gold Core is sometimes left untranslated as “Jindan” or is more literally translated as Golden Pellet. In scholarly articles on Chinese internal alchemy, it is translated as the “Golden Elixir“. It is somewhat analogous to the Philosopher’s Stone of Western alchemy, although there are many differences between the two.

The information below is based heavily on the [ImmortalMountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/cores-in-chinese-cultivation-novels/) page on Cores in Chinese Fiction, unless otherwise noted. 

# Beast Cores (Protocores)
"Beast Cores" belong to a specific subset of animals that are capable of [[cultivation]]. This can include regular animals, but also mythical creatures like dragons, leviathans, phoenixes, and more. This is a general concept so different authors/stories will use different nuances. 
* (Note that the [Chinese dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon), also known as a long or loong, is quite different from western dragons. The game's lore blends Eastern and Western dragon lore, especially in [[Sylus]]'s character.)

Some beasts are born with cores, while others develop them over time as they grow stronger. Note that generally, even fairly weak beasts have cores, and in many tellings all beast are born with them. Beasts can also have a variety of natures, from "divine beasts" to "demonic beasts" to the more neutral "magical beasts." "Beast" itself can also be translated to "monster", "demon" or "devil" depending on the context.

Note that there are also **Yao** (妖 yāo) (as in Yokai (JP)/[Yaoguai (CN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoguai)) which can be translated to "demon" but culturally is more like "fae". These creatures can also have cores, but can develop from anything--plants, inanimate objects, etc.

In the LaDS world, [[Wanderer]]s are such creatures. They develop [[Protocore]]s as they grow stronger, and range from harmless and friendly beings (such as the fluffy [[Wanderer]] in Xavier's [[Garden of Secrets]] memory) to powerful mindless killers that will devour each other (as mentioned in a loading screen). The origins given for Wanderers in their in-game shows that they are Yao-like beings, derived from natural energy and objects like polluted water, powerful storms, statues, etc.

Note this description from  [ImmortalMountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/cores-in-chinese-cultivation-novels/):
> These Beasts often possess a **Core** within their bodies which contains their magical energy and [essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Treasures_(traditional_Chinese_medicine)) (basically “lifeblood/lifeforce”). Cultivators highly prize these Cores and hunt the Beasts to obtain them. The Cores are generally either sold for money, used to craft magical items, or consumed by a cultivator to boost their cultivation

Compare to the game:
* Hunters kill Wanderers to obtain their cores
* Cores are sold and traded for money, and "high-risk" cores from particularly dangerous Wanderers are especially valuable
* [[Protocore weapon]]s are analogous to using Protocores to craft magical items. Viewed through a sci-fi lens, magic becomes technology. [[Protocore]]s and their energy enable supernatural feats/items such as the floating city of [[Skyhaven]] or even [[Mephisto]] himself
* In [[Beyond Cloudfall]], there's a reference to [[Sylus - Abysm Sovereign]] consuming [[Wanderer]] [[Protocore]]s as sustenance instead of human souls.

Note that [[Sylus]], being a dragon originally, would have a Beast Core. His powers awaken quickly in his early life.
# Cultivator Cores (Aether Cores)
This is a key theme in [[Xianxia]], as [[cultivation]] is the process of human heroes (usually practicers of mystic or martial arts) achieving immortality. Unlike Beasts, only a very few humans are able to create a core. This core comes from their "[dantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dantian)" which to oversimplify in western terms is essential their "soul" or "inner power". 

These rare cores are called (金丹 jīndān) and are commonly translated as "Gold Core" or "Golden Core" because they're depicted as "as a small, golden orb crystallized from the condensation of Qi." ([ImmortalMountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/cores-in-chinese-cultivation-novels/))

The second character, **丹**, is connected to the idea of an "elixer of life" or "elixer of immortality" thematically very similar to the [Philosopher's Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone). The color is gold because this is the goal of alchemy. But Chinese philosophy tended more towards searching out an inner source for immortality vs. an external alchemical source over time.

The first and most obvious connection here is that the [[Aether Core]]s depicted in the game are golden, intentionally evoking this idea of a cultivator core. The [[modified Protocore]] seen in [[01-03 Talented Hunter]] is even specifically a golden sphere. Likewise, MC's power is depicted as [[golden light]].

MC's [[Aether Core]] originally manifests when she resurrects from her medical death during [[Ever]]'s experiments (see [[Josephine's secret notes]]). The game leans into the heart/soul connection, placing the core around her heart (connecting to themes of love) instead of in the lower dantian as would be typical in more classical fiction. She's able to absorb power from the other [[Aether Core]], as opposed to from the Beast Cores i.e. [[Protocore]]s, but the connection to absorbing power for [[cultivation]] remains.
