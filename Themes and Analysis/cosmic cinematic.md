These "cinematics" (i.e. videos that play without you needing to advance text) share key but mysterious details about the game's lore. They're all collected here so they can be read one after another, with their commentary in context.

# Singularity Echo
From [[01-01.00 Singularity Echo]]:
> `The camera sweeps past a planet and a moon. A spaceship appears.` (The [[Traceback II]])
> Day 1326 
> Attention: Target Anchor Lost
> No response from base.
> [[Traceback II]] is about to pass the event horizon and enter the [[black hole]].
> `The ship drifts past the planet, and in the distance, light spirals around a dark circle. The screen goes black.`
> We are stuck in this loop... 
> `A small light pulses in the dark between these lines of text.`
> This never-ending journey...

## Commentary
A [Gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), in general relativity, is a point in which gravity is so intense that [[spacetime]] itself becomes ill-defined. This hints at the general [[spacetime]] shenanigans in the story, including the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], the [[converging timelines]], and the time travel of the [[Backtrackers]] (whose ship is the [[Traceback II]]).


# End of Under Deepspace
From [[01-08.10 Trap]]:
> Female voice: [[Traceback II]] will reach the edge of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]'s umbra within one day. Our journey through the Deepspace Tunnel begins. Destination is in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way--Once the home of humanity: Earth. Activating Course Correction Engine. The Final countdown has been initiated...
> `During this sequence, the background shows a nebula on a starry background. The nebula brightens until it looks conspicuously like an eye. Then, it fades.`
> Male news voice: When alpha-Po159's light shines through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], illuminating [[Linkon Tower]]'s pinnacle... The closest we've been to it in the last 4.6 billion years. This galaxy's name is derived from the old word "philo". It's the most exquisite gem in Deepspace. Humanity remains shackled to time. There are other lives in this boundless, starry sea. Tonights weather: Clear sky with winds around 7 miles/hr. Everything is serene inside the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. Good night, [[Linkon]] City. May you rest in the Milky Way's embrace, drifting in long and happy dreams.
* (([[Philos]] is solidly a planet, but due to [[celestial bodies in CN]] the localization can get a bit confusing. Though it's referred to as a 'galaxy' here, the CN for 'star system' and 'galaxy' are identical, so it's all referring to Philos. Note that planets are visible like stars in the night sky, so the light reaching Earth via the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] is the planet's light.))

In the background, we see Xavier, then Zayne, then Rafayel.
Xavier uses a [[Flux Nexus]] near the remains of a space ship. ((The [[Traceback II]]))
Zayne uses his Evol on an ice wall under the aurora.
Rafayel sits on his ladder, painting a blue wall--but then the image cuts over and he's gone, and the peaceful blue is now marked with a blood red stream.

## Commentary
The most straightforward interpretation here is that across both the Singularity Echo cinematic and this one, we're getting two different timelines--the [[Traceback II]] headed for Earth and present-day Earth. The Traceback II's timeline seems to be in reverse order--the time loop mentioned in Singularity Echo is references as their difficulties in Deepspace in [[WU-04 From The Stars]], whereas the voice over here seems to be from the beginning of their journey. (Technically speaking, their journey began in the future and proceeded into the past, so this "reverse" order is accurate and likely intentional.)

# End of Long Awaited Revelry
From [[02-02.12 Resonance's Power]]:

> `Black background.`
> And so I left the [[N109 Zone]]. 
> The dust settled.
> `A silhouette of Sylus walking away, with his blazer over his shoulders` ([[Sylus - Relentless Conquerer]])
> But the deal with Sylus lingered, 
> like a silent yet turbulent mist.
> I found myself falling into an abyss
> in the blink of an eye.
> `The frozen spaceship (same as in the Protofield)`
> The doors of memory swung open.
> And something began to stir.
> `The scene changes to the orb-like tower on the Justicar's platform.` (See [[02-02.11 Battle - Into the Vortex]], [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]])
> It is...
> another world I had once glimpsed.
> `The abyss/Tarus is visible with lava at the foot of black rock.`
> `The screen goes black.`
> At the confluence of the entwined timelines,
> I heard it.
> A faint yet distinct heartbeat.
> `A small star of light drifts downward in the black field. The star contacts a planet, briefly illuminating it from behind--it's Earth. Then, the glow shifts to the core of the planet and it begins to fracture, light streaming out from the massive cracks in the planet's surface.`
* ((See also [[cosmic heartbeat]], [[branching timelines]], [[converging timelines]]))

## Commentary

### Planet fracturing
Crucially, this cinematic seems to depict the formation of [[Philos]]--specifically, the fracturing of Earth into Plates. ((See also [[When Shooting Stars Fall]].))

One interpretation is to identify the spark of light in the Singularity Echo cinematic as being the same one here that descends to earth and then triggers/heralds the fracturing.

### Doors of memory
After the vision she had before resonating with Sylus, MC begins to remember "another world I had once glimpsed" (i.e. [[Philos]]). The imagery is from the illustrated backgrounds and [[Protofield]]s that represent these locations in the game. There's the frozen space ship, the judgement platform, and Tarus/the abyss. MC also specifically mentions "I found myself falling into an abyss" which is a reference to [[Beyond Cloudfall]].

### Entwined timelines
