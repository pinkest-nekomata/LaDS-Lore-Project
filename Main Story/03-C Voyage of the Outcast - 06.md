# Summary
As [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] wait to meet [[Soren]] at the basketball court by the student union, and chat about students with secrets. [[Xavier]] ends up talking about when he'd make eye contact with [[Academy MC]] in class. It sounds familiar, yet she reflects that there's so much she doesn't know about Xavier.

Notably, when MC is worried that they might not see [[Soren]], [[Xavier]] says confidently that unless he has an Evol that lets him sprout wings and fly away, they'll definitely see when he leaves the student union. ((This foreshadows that [[Soren]] is actually able to teleport.))

When one of the other students appears, though previously saying he'd be taking a week off due to the attack, they head over to ask him questions.

# Details

[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] wait to meet [[Soren]] at the basketball court. MC reflects:
> It's hard to fully appreciate this rare sunset, something I haven't seen much since graduation.
* ((We know she went to [[Linkon University]], so this is perhaps more a general reflection about her campus days.))

As they wait and make their plan to confront [[Soren]], Xavier assures her that they'll see him when he leaves the student union--unless his Evol lets him sprout wings and fly away. ((This foreshadows that [[Soren]] can also teleport.))

[[MC]] reflects that if the [[Wanderer]] attacks are following such a clear pattern, and [[Soren]] is trying to disguise it, then perhaps the entire mission is a set-up after all. MC hopes that it's a coincidence and he really is a diligent student after all.

But [[Xavier]] shares a meaningful reflection, which subtly applies also to himself:
> Xavier: Perhaps it's because he looks like a good student that makes him the best at doing things behind the scenes. After all, people don't write their secrets on their faces. The calmer the water's surface, the easier it is to hide dangerous undercurrents.

MC confronts him about his own secrets, remembering the yellowed photo in the lab. She reflects on all the versions of Xavier she's known, and how she still hasn't figured him out. He plays dumb, so she ends up just asking:
> MC: I was going to ask if... If you're truly a good student. Or do you have some secrets?
> *After thinking for a moment, he speaks in a calm tone.*
> Xavier: I'd say... I'm a good student. I paid attention during class and always kept my eyes on the front of the classroom. that's how I kept making eye contact with a classmate who frequently turned around during class.
> *He looks at me with a knowing gaze. I look back into his eyes and feel as if everything sounds familiar.*
* ((This is a direct reference to [[When Shooting Stars Fall]]))
> MC: ...Maybe your classmate just wanted to check the clock at the back of the classroom. See how much time was left before class was over.
> Xavier: Oh... You're asking if I have a hidden side to me like Soren? \[...] But... the parts of me you think you know and the parts you think you don't know... They make up who I am. All of me, right here in front of you.

Xavier breaks the tender moment by pointing out a "new lead"--They see another student from the attack and go decide to ask him some more questions.
