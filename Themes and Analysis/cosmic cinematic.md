These "cinematics" (i.e. videos that play without you needing to advance text) share key but mysterious details about the game's lore. They're all collected here so they can be read one after another, with their commentary in context.

# Singularity Echo
From [[01-01.00 Singularity Echo]]:
> `The camera sweeps past a planet and a moon. A spaceship appears.` (The [[Traceback II]])
> Day 1326 
> Attention: Target Anchor Lost
> No response from base.
> [[Traceback II]] is about to pass the event horizon and enter the [[black hole]].
> `The ship drifts past the planet, and in the distance, light spirals around a dark circle. The screen goes black.`
> We are stuck in this loop... 
> `A small light pulses in the dark between these lines of text.`
> This never-ending journey...

## Commentary
A [Gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), in general relativity, is a point in which gravity is so intense that [[spacetime]] itself becomes ill-defined. This hints at the general [[spacetime]] shenanigans in the story, including the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], the [[converging timelines]], and the time travel of the [[Backtrackers]] (whose ship is the [[Traceback II]]).


# End of Under Deepspace
From [[01-08.10 Trap]]:
> Female voice: [[Traceback II]] will reach the edge of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]'s umbra within one day. Our journey through the Deepspace Tunnel begins. Destination is in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way--Once the home of humanity: Earth. Activating Course Correction Engine. The Final countdown has been initiated...
> `During this sequence, the background shows a nebula on a starry background. The nebula brightens until it looks conspicuously like an eye. Then, it fades.`
> Male news voice: When alpha-Po159's light shines through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], illuminating [[Linkon Tower]]'s pinnacle... The closest we've been to it in the last 4.6 billion years. This galaxy's name is derived from the old word "philo". It's the most exquisite gem in Deepspace. Humanity remains shackled to time. There are other lives in this boundless, starry sea. Tonights weather: Clear sky with winds around 7 miles/hr. Everything is serene inside the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. Good night, [[Linkon]] City. May you rest in the Milky Way's embrace, drifting in long and happy dreams.
* (([[Philos]] is solidly a planet, but due to [[celestial bodies in CN]] the localization can get a bit confusing. Though it's referred to as a 'galaxy' here, the CN for 'star system' and 'galaxy' are identical, so it's all referring to Philos. Note that planets are visible like stars in the night sky, so the light reaching Earth via the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] is the planet's light.))

In the background, we see Xavier, then Zayne, then Rafayel.
Xavier uses a [[Flux Nexus]] near the remains of a space ship. ((The [[Traceback II]]))
Zayne uses his Evol on an ice wall under the aurora.
Rafayel sits on his ladder, painting a blue wall--but then the image cuts over and he's gone, and the peaceful blue is now marked with a blood red stream.

## Commentary
The most straightforward interpretation here is that across both the Singularity Echo cinematic and this one, we're getting two different timelines--the [[Traceback II]] headed for Earth and present-day Earth. The Traceback II's timeline seems to be in reverse order--the time loop mentioned in Singularity Echo is references as their difficulties in Deepspace in [[WU-04 From The Stars]], whereas the voice over here seems to be from the beginning of their journey. (Technically speaking, their journey began in the future and proceeded into the past, so this "reverse" order is accurate and likely intentional.)

# End of Long Awaited Revelry
From [[02-02.12 Resonance's Power]]:

> `Black background.`
> And so I left the [[N109 Zone]]. 
> The dust settled.
> `A silhouette of Sylus walking away, with his blazer over his shoulders` ([[Sylus - Relentless Conquerer]])
> But the deal with Sylus lingered, 
> like a silent yet turbulent mist.
> I found myself falling into an abyss
> in the blink of an eye.
> `The frozen spaceship (same as in the Protofield)`
> The doors of memory swung open.
> And something began to stir.
> `The scene changes to the orb-like tower on the Justicar's platform.` (See [[02-02.11 Battle - Into the Vortex]], [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]])
> It is...
> another world I had once glimpsed.
> `The abyss/Tarus is visible with lava at the foot of black rock.`
> `The screen goes black.`
> At the confluence of the entwined timelines,
> I heard it.
> A faint yet distinct heartbeat.
> `A small star of light drifts downward in the black field. The star contacts a planet, briefly illuminating it from behind--it's Earth. Then, the glow shifts to the core of the planet and it begins to fracture, light streaming out from the massive cracks in the planet's surface. Notably, the orientation of the glow resembles a vertical pupil and may be another reference to a giant eye.`
* ((See also [[cosmic heartbeat]], [[branching timelines]], [[converging timelines]]))

## Commentary

### Planet fracturing
Crucially, this cinematic seems to depict the formation of [[Philos]]--specifically, the fracturing of Earth into Plates. ((See also [[When Shooting Stars Fall]].))

One interpretation is to identify the spark of light in the Singularity Echo cinematic as being the same one here that descends to earth and then triggers/heralds the fracturing.

### Doors of memory
After the vision she had before resonating with Sylus, MC begins to remember "another world I had once glimpsed" (i.e. [[Philos]]). The imagery is from the illustrated backgrounds and [[Protofield]]s that represent these locations in the game. There's the frozen space ship, the judgement platform, and Tarus/the abyss. MC also specifically mentions "I found myself falling into an abyss" which is a reference to [[Beyond Cloudfall]].

### Entwined timelines
See also [[converging timelines]].

# End of Prologue to Tomorrow
From [[03-01.04 No Ends]]:
Storm clouds rage and the sky dims. [[The giant red eye]] looks down from above--this time, it resembles both a nebula and a mechanical lens. Wind swirls, and buildings seem to disintegrate around it. The following text appears:
> Again...?!
> My heart responds to that eye...
> The world around me fades
> But the call I hear becomes clearer
> It's behind that
> Somewhere in the distance...
> Lies the power of [[Aether Core]]

## Commentary

### The eye
So far, [[the giant red eye]] theme started with a mechanical-seeming eye that resembled a [[patrol robot]], and was echoed in a nebula-like eye that occurs when [[Sylus]] uses his power. This time, we see an eye that resembles both a mechanical lens and a nebula, and we see it clearly across the sky. Given the ominous, foreboding nature, it's fair to consider whether this is connected to the [[cosmic heartbeat]] as well. In [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]], [[Xavier]] says the [[Aether Core]]s power come from "the core of the cosmos", which seems to be hinted at here.

#todo check if the fragment is found in [[Skyhaven]]

# Start of Homecoming Wings
Though not a full cinematic, [[MC]] further reflects on the scene that ends Prologue to Tomorrow:

The narrative picks up directly form [[03-01.04 No Ends]], with the eye-like nebula as the background, though it's not as distinctly red in this image.

> My vision goes dark. Everything blurs as the universe finds a strange stillness inits chaos. And then it fades to nothing.
> A strong resonance pulses through my body. It stirs fragmented memories that drift like fading apparitions.
> A pale planet appears. It's strange yet familiar...
> And then there's an overwhelming force as silent as a black hole...
> It's... a massive, artificial "eye".

An explosion is heard and fire moves across the screen, leaving red embers.
> ...It's been a while since I dreamed about the explosion.
> Looking back, those roaring flames feel like a surreal, distant nightmare.
> The searing heat in my dreams is still vivid but the pain in my heart is gone. Maybe it's because...
> The [[Aether Core]] within me has achieved full power.

# End of Homecoming Wings
Instead of a cinematic, [[04 Homecoming Wings]] ends with this poem:
> In a forest where shattered stars rest, a crystalline pool appears.
> As if infused with the wine of life, it's clear yet murky.
> Young Traveler, do not drink from it.
> Lost Lover, do not drink from it.
> But when flowers wither in their sleep, when winds fall silent, when the vigilant owl closes its eyes--
> Only then can you drink deep of these waters.
> Let the Dead sing:
> "O Fountain of Atei! Cleanse my time, nourish my flesh, spare me from the loneliness of eternal rest!
> Spare me from the loneliness of eternal rest..."

See also [[The Fountain of Atei]].

# All From Deepspace
This cinematic occurs in the middle of the [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]] chapter--note how the chapter name itself evokes the theme of [[converging timelines]].

Against a black background:
> What... Am I?
> In bounding darkness,
> I drift through the cosmos.
> `A golden aether core floats in front of outer space imagery: nebulas, a planet, and what appear to be shimmery blue portals.`
> It's like I'm part of it.
> I am the cosmos.
> I see a planet on the brink of destruction. And the different paths it could take.
> `We zoom in on the planet and a wipe effect changes the colors and textures of the surface. Red > blue > white > gaseous swirls > lava, etc, going faster and faster.`
> Some explode like tiny fireworks before their life could begin.
> `Cracks spread across the planet, glowing bright, then the planet explodes.`
> Others are further along in their journey.
> `A grey hollow shell of a planet with chunks missing.`
> However, all of them perish.
> `Swirling light surrounds the planet.`
> And at the endof their lives, each planet collapses inward.
> A tiny core takes its place.
> The one born from destruction: the [[Origo Core]].
> `In the background, the planet collapses.`
> It silently floats in space as energy stirs from its slumber. Cosmic strings resonate with it. [[Spacetime]] twists and stretches.
> `There's a fractal kaleidoscope effect over the image of the core. Zooming, in the core explodes, then the screen goes white.`
> Everything and nothing has changed.
> The [[Origo Core]] descends upon a planet nearing collapse.
> `We see the planet again, this itme tan and bluish. Beside it, there's a dark spot surrounded by swirling light.`
> It's waiting for the end and its own birth.

After the cinematic:
> My awareness gradually fades as my body feels weightless. The ethereal eye appears once more. It devours me completely this time.
> All the sensations in my body disappear as the scene before me gradually fades into darkness.
> Suddenly, I "hear" a strong heartbeat and "feel" a warm power flow through me.
> It's a fragment from another place and time. Yet it brings a familiar presence. Everything that was lost has returned to me.
> At first, they're just blurry images reminiscent of scattered, flickering stars in my mind.
> But as time passes, these images start to become clear. They slowly come together and form vivid, tangible scenes. Complete with sounds, textures, temperatures, and even the faintest presence, they're real and full of life.
> Unfamiliar fragments connect into a single, unbroken thread. Those past experiences, emotions, choices, and missions—
> Once again, they cross the barriers of time and space.
> Carefully weaving themselves into the fabric of my existence, they become a part of me.

## Commentary
### The nature of Philos
This cinematic finally gives us concrete details about the nature of Philos--namely, that each myth is a "what if" for the same planet in the [[branching timelines]], and each "version" doesn't necessarily interact with the others. Refer to [[Philos]] for further discussion.

### The nature of MC
This cinematic confirms that MC herself is a cosmic force. Her existence is tied to that of [[Philos]] and its many versions, represented by the various [[Aether Core]]s.

For more on her rebirth, refer to [[MC's Rebirth Deep Dive]]

### The Origo Core
Since "Origo" means "origin" (see [[Origo Core]]), the core is depicted as gold, and the cinematic shows its rebirth as MC is "dying" and being "reborn", we can conclude that the Origo Core is the one MC originally manifested with and completed in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]].

We see it return to Earth as she "resurrects":
> The [[Origo Core]] descends upon a planet nearing collapse. It's waiting for the end and its own birth.

[[05-02.07 When the Snow Falls]] confirms that the "planet nearing collapse" mentioned here is the Earth of the main story timeline. Compare:
> Some say Earth's climate system has broken down, and a disaster comparable to the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] is imminent.
> Others claim Earth is on the verge of collapse. All tectonic plates will shatter, and thus human civilization will end.

Side note, the tectonic plates shattering is the fate that befell the [[Philos]] in [[Shooting Stars]] (and potentially other versions of Philos, though none are specifically confirmed).

This time, her memories remain intact due to [[Sylus and MC's Evol linkage]], see [[MC's Rebirth Deep Dive]] for more.
