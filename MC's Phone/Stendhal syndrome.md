# Key info
> A local collector who acquired one of Rafayel's artworks suddenly ceased to eat, drink, and engage with the outside world. He locked himself in a room, spending his time with the painting. It appears he might be suffering from a serious mental illness. The specific cause remains unknown. Rumors suggest the painting is enchanted with magic. Others claim the collector was attacked by a Wanderer, leading to his symptoms. However, the art world, almost as if pulled by an irresistible force, has turned its attention to this mysterious masterpiece and Rafayel himself.

This is a reference to [[Raymond]]'s condition before his death.
