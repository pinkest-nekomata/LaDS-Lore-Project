As one of the main story's central driving events, the timing of the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] is key to putting the rest of the timeline in context. However, in initially released content, there was not a clear date/season given. [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] specifies that the explosion happens during winter, though there's some discrepancies to note, which are discussed below.

# Summary
[[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] specifically places the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] when snow is on the ground in 2048, meaning the month is most likely Nov or Dec.

Since the explosion happened in Nov/Dec 2048, then the time skip of "over six months" places [[01-04.04 A Real Nightmare]] circa June/July/August 2049, but we can actually conclude it's either July or August.

Specifically, [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] must take place in autumn once the school year has started, which is usually in September. Since there's no time skip between [[01-08 Galactic Sunset]] and [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], and the time skip between [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]] and [[03-01.01 Imbalance]] is specified as two months, then [[Hunting Day]] must be the third Sunday of July or August. 
# Commentary
## Before Serpent's Cast
At first, the visit depicted in [[01-04.01 Family]] seems to be the visit "at the end of the month" that [[Caleb]] and [[MC]] discuss in [[01-01.09 Rainfall Curtain]]. Since [[01-01.09 Rainfall Curtain]] happens circa July 2048 ([[Timeline Analysis - Main Story Begins]]) this visit seems to be only a couple of weeks later at most.

However, there's a tiny clue that more time has passed--[[Grandma]] specifically mentions that it's been a while since [[MC]] last visited and that she's been busy since she became a hunter, which doesn't perfectly fit it only having been a couple of weeks.

Visually, the weather appears to be nice and the season could be summer or early fall, but visual clues like this are always low-confidence. See also [[Meta Analysis - Using Visual Clues]].

Also note the title of [[01-07.06 Spring Excursion]], which seems to place [[Hunting Day]] in spring, consistent with a shorter time skip before [[01-04.01 Family]].

The main problem with this interpretation is that ultimately not enough time passes for it to be autumn during [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]].

## After Serpent's Cast
[[WU-19 Serpent's Cast#05 Former Acquaintance]] seems to very intentionally give us some concrete dates for [[Caleb]]'s timeline that we were previously missing (including a [retcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity) of his official age, see below for more) which means that the mention of snow on the ground during the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] is likely very intentional.

Notably, by placing the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] in Nov/Dec 2048, the approximate timelines line up correctly for [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] to be in autumn. Thus, in my opinion, [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] is an intentional [retcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity) to fix the main story timeline, taking advantage of the vague time skip before [[01-04.01 Family]] in order to lengthen it and ensure everything lines up correctly. 

As noted above, with the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] being in Nov/Dec, then the chapter [[01-07.06 Spring Excursion]] must occur in summer (June/July), not spring.

### Caleb's age
It's worth going into further depth on the apparent retcon of Caleb's age here too. [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast#05 Former Acquaintance]] specifically states that Caleb was 21 and a third-year student (Junior) at the DAA in midsummer 2044. So, he must have finished 3rd year and started 4th year in 2044. This seems to intentionally override the age given in [[Summer's Echo]].

[[Summer's Echo]] specifically says Caleb is 17 *or* 18 at the end of the summer between freshman and sophomore year of college. This is what you'd write if you (1) knew that Caleb was 9 or 10 at the time of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] in 2034 (as implied by [[Pathless Realm#05 Arrival]]) and (2) weren't taking into account that his birthday is in June, before the time of [[Summer's Echo]]. Since the memory is late summer, he'd have to be 18 turning 19 this year based on the dates in [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]], which is itself consistent with his About Him age.
