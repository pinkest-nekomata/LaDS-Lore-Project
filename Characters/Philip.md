> "To better understand your heart's condition, I tried to contact those researchers privately. But most had either died or disappeared. It'd be hard to find any of them today. Ah, I do recall your grandmother mentioning one had run away to... the [[N109 Zone]]. They joined [[Onychinus]]."

# Other Info

[[WU-10 Mischief]] reveals that [[Philip]] was also a subject of [[Ever]]'s twin experiments, and the pair's subject ID was 303. Philip is the younger of the twins, and it's implied that his twin died. When [[Sylus]] takes in [[Luke and Kieran]], Philip helps create their distinctive masks so they can still appear as twins.

## Commentary

### Time at Ever
[[Philip]] claims he doesn't know much about Josephine ([[Grandma]]) in ([[02 Long Awaited Revelry]] #todo specific citation) though he says he previously worked monitoring [[Aether Core]]s. [[WU-10 Mischief]] reveals that [[Philip]] is not only a researcher for [[Ever]], but also a subject of their twin experiments who survived despite [[Ever]] expecting him to die. 

There are a couple of uncertain elements here:
* Was [[Philip]] experimented on before or after his time monitoring the [[Aether Core]]s?
	* [[Ever]] is unlikely to have any qualms recruiting (or conscripting) their own employees for experiments, so it's possible he and his twin were experiment subjects after the experiments on MC, and his time overlapped with [[Luke and Kieran]]. This would also give him a key reason to flee to the [[N109 Zone]].
	* Or, [[Philip]] may have started as a twin experiment and after his unexpected survival became a researcher. If this is the case, then he would not have overlapped with [[Luke and Kieran]].
* Did [[Philip]] work on monitoring MC's [[Aether Core]], or another core/cores later?
	* There's a strong chance that the [[Aether Core]] that [[Sherman]]/[[Onychinus]] has access to is from [[Ever]], so Philip could have worked on that prior to leaving. If this is the case, then Josephine would have had to find out about him later, vs. looking for him as one of her former colleagues
	* It's more straightforward if Philip worked on MC's case, and if he was a lowly lab tech, that would explain why he doesn't know much about Josephine or recognize MC initially. If he was a twin experiment before this point, then he wouldn't have overlapped with [[Luke and Kieran]], so they would only know his reputation. But if he was a twin experiment afterwards, he could have overlapped with them. Perhaps he first "disappeared" when he became his experiment, and then Josephine learned of his escape when he fled to the [[N109 Zone]].
