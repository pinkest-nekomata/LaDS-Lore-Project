# Summary
[[Xavier]] tries to discourage [[MC]] from agreeing to take on the mission. But if she does, she should pick him as her partner.

# Details

[[MC]] realizes the empty desk next to hers belongs to [[Xavier]]. He nudges her to make her decision. She nudges him about the [[Flux Nexus]], especially since the [[Hunters Association]] doesn't yet seem to know of its function, or that one was found in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]. He dances around the question, playing dumb and saying he only knows the name. ((This is almost certainly a lie, given his history.))

Xavier overall tries to discourage MC from taking on the mission, citing the danger (and that the Association may not disclose the full amount of danger). His plan backfires and he piques her curiosity instead. Ultimately, he says that if she does decide to get involved, she should pick him as her partner.

((The implication is that [[Xavier]] knows more about [[Onychinus]] and what's going on than even [[Jenna]] does.))
