"Walking up to the display case, I see the stones are a vibrant red, almost like blood." -- [[MC]], [[01-02.07 Heard About It]]

These suspicious stones have a slight [[Metaflux]] fluctuation which leads [[MC]] to them in [[Flux Arts]].

During [[01-02.10 Fiery Blood]], Rafayel adds a drop of his [[Lemurian]] blood onto the stone. Flames spring forth from within, as well as an illusion of blue mist and a little fish. [[Metaflux]] fluctuations occur right after, and a [[Wanderer]] appears. Once the Wanderer is dealt with, MC scans the coral stones and determines that the [[Metaflux]] levels are even higher now, likely due to the addition of [[Rafayel]]'s blood.
