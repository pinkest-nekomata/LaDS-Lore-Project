# Spacepedia
A mechanical crow that always accompanies Sylus. He's very skilled but has a temper. Sylus doesn't treat him as a pet.

# Other Info

In at least one [[Moments]] post, Sylus confirms that he did not program all of Mephisto's traits. Many of them are normal crow traits. This implies that [[Mephisto]] is more of a cyborg than a purely robotic creature.

First appearance: In [[No-Hunt Zone 7]], during [[01-03.08 Where Light Vanishes]]
* So, [[Sylus]] knew some of [[MC]]'s whereabouts before she arrived in the [[N109 Zone]]
* He also knows she can resonate with the [[Flux Nexus]] and retrieve the [[Protocore]] inside
* He could have been tracking her, [[Xavier]], the fluctuations, the no-hunt zone generally, or the [[Flux Nexus]].
