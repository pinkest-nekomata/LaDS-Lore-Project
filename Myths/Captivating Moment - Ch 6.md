# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Sylus]] share a quiet sunrise moment in the park, though Sylus quickly points out they're being tailed. While MC was oblivious at first, she's again a quick learner, spotting a jogger as being one of the people watching them.

They share breakfast together from a nearby food cart, and a stray cat wanders over. Another puzzle piece falls into place--Sylus is fond of small animals. After startling the stray, he gets tuna from the food cart to feed it and the others.

As the people trailing them gather, Sylus invites MC back onto his motorcycle. He speeds out onto [[Linkon]]'s streets, quickly losing their pursuers.

## Commentary

### Main Story Timeline
This myth pretty clearly fits into [[Operation Aether Ordeal]], and notes the season to be spring. This is in line with the most simple interpretation of the time skips leading up to [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]], except that [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] specifically notes the season to be autumn. [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] specifically places the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] in winter to resolve this discrepancy. See also [[Main Story Timeline Discrepancies]].

# Details
They leave the building at sunrise, heading through a nearby park. MC is initially relieved, but this reveals that she still has more to learn.

> MC: We barely managed to escape. I wonder how many people were waiting for the order to be given.
> Sylus: Who said we're safe just because we got out of the building? Kovi's men are tailing us. Ten o'clock, six o'clock, and three o'clock. Oh and there are snipers on the roof. Both sides.
> MC: ...
> Sylus: How does it feel to greet a new day with so many people lurking in the shadows?
> *Sylus's face shows no signs of anxiety. His nonchalant tone makes it sound like he just said "good morning."*
> MC: It's... It feels more dangerous compared to the movies.
> *A breakfast food cart slowly passes us. Sylus suddenly chuckles.*
> Sylus: Are you hungry?
> MC: How can you have an appetite when there are so many people ready to ambush us?
> Sylus: Considering how calm and collected you were at the card table, shouldn't having an appetite be easy for you?
> *Under a tree, Sylus and I sit on a bench and eat our sandwiches.*
> *Sunlight filters through the branches, and a breeze carries spring's fragrance. The tree's pink blossoms tremble slightly in the wind.*
> *Everything's so beautiful and serene. It's almost surreal.*
> MC: As much as I'm enjoying this moment of peace, the person on his morning jog is also after us, right?
> Sylus: Good eye. But it's not just me they're targeting. After all, you won the bid, sweetie.
> MC: What bid?
> Sylus: It's for a new kind of weapon.
> MC: ...
> *I choke and can't stop coughing after.*
> MC: Cough, cough... They think I... want to compete with them for weapons?
> *Sylus pats my back and speaks in a somewhat teasing tone.*
> Sylus: The speed and momentum of your punches earlier didn't seem to care about who was present.
> MC: They were after my life. I doubt I could take my time. But I listened to your advice. My punches are a lot faster now.
> *Sylus thoughtfully looks at my hand.*
> Sylus: You applied what you learned on your first run. The teachers at the [[Hunters Academy]] must have liked you.
> MC: And now I want to be liked by you.
> Sylus: Your goal is clearly written on your face. You don't need to say it.
> *A stray cat, guided by the smell of food, approaches. It cautiously peers at us from the side of the bench.*
> *Surprisingly, Sylus bends down to play with it. The wary feline immediately raises its paw and scratches Sylus.*
> Sylus: ...
> MC: You can't just touch strays. They're alert because the outside world is dangerous.
> *Sylus suddenly stands up. His entire body carries a subtle, dangerous aura. The cat is intimidated and takes a few steps back.*
> MC: You're not mad at the cat, right? It was only protecting itself.
> *Sylus walks over to the food truck on the side of the road.*
> Sylus: Boss, do you have any dried fish?
> Vendor: No, but we have canned tuna.
> Sylus: I'll take all of it.
> MC: ...?
> *Sylus arranges the canned tuna on the ground in a row. The cat calls over other stray cats.*
> *Sylus watches them eat side by side. The sharp contours of his face appear softer than usual.*
> *I just collected another puzzle piece related to Sylus.*
> MC: Your enemies would be shocked if they saw you like this.
> Sylus: They'll probably wish to be reborn as animals in their next life. They wouldn't have to fight me then.
> MC: Do you like animals?
> Sylus: I don't like or dislike them. To me, they're harmless.
> MC: But you're kinder to these weaklings than most.
> Sylus: Just because you're stronger doesn't mean you stand above the weak.
> *Sylus abruptly looks at a person in the distance, his expression returning to what it usually is—a subtle sneer.*
> Sylus: Compared to those who overestimate themselves, small animals are nicer.
> MC: I think they're trying to seal off the park.
> Sylus: Perfect. We can get rid of them in one fell swoop.
> MC: Wait, there are civilians here. Let's go somewhere else.
> *Sylus turns his head to glance at me. Then he stands up.*
> Sylus: Ah yes, you're truly Linkon's righteous guardian, Miss Hunter.
> MC: ...Why does that sound like an insult coming out of your mouth?
> Sylus: I'm being sincere.
> *Sylus tosses me a motorcycle helmet. The figures, though still far away, are closing in on us.*
> MC: You could've headed home when we left the building. Why did you want to have breakfast?
* ((It's worth noting here that Sylus also clearly wants to spend time with MC, but he's not saying that outright yet.))

> Sylus: It's not often I get to see plants. I wanted to appreciate them.
> MC: ...Aren't there plants in the N109 Zone?
> Sylus: They're fake. You can't tell unless you take a closer look.
> *Leaning against his motorcycle, Sylus looks at the tree canopy in front of him.*
> *The tree covered in blooming, pink flowers looks like cotton candy under the sun.*
* ((It's specifically noted to be spring, but there are some inconsistencies regarding the season of [[Operation Aether Ordeal]]. See also [[Main Story Timeline Discrepancies]].))

> Sylus: Plants struggle to grow when there's no sunlight. So, people in the N109 Zone are used to living without plants.
> MC: The vegetation here might be surprised that someone would get himself into danger just to see them.
> *Sylus smiles.*
> Sylus: It's spring, after all. Besides, how dangerous can these people be?
> *Sylus puts on his helmet, and wraps my arms around his waist.*
> Sylus: Hold on tight.

MC notes how his fast speed throws off their pursuers, and that the places where they touch each other are the only things that are real.
