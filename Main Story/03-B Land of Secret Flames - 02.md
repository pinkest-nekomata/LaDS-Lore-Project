# Summary
Three days later, they're on a yacht headed to the private island where the main celebration will occur. [[Maxwell]] is suspected of buying an [[Aether Core]] fragment disguised as a piece of jewelry for his wife. So, they're undercover trying to get a closer look. ((Unlike the in-game visuals, the writing especially in Ch 04 indicates their masks cover their whole faces and fully hide their identities.))

[[Rafayel]] has taken the mask intended for [[Yosef]], a man over 70, and a sharp-eyed man in a Jester mask notices this. [[Rafayel]] quickly spins a story about how he's attending on the elderly man's behalf, and when [[Maxwell]] announces the upcoming itinerary, [[Jester]] leaves them alone for now.

## Commentary
Rafayel's [[Rafayel - Phantom of the Siren]] outfit and opera career are references to the [[Siren's Song]] anecdote--he did indeed spend some time as a successful opera singer in [[Verona]].

# Details
[[MC]] flashes back to her mission details. [[Jenna]] reports that [[Maxwell]] has made a suspicious purchase--he bought a piece of jewelry for far more than it should have been worth. They suspect this was an illegal [[Protocore]] deal, expensive enough to be related to an [[Aether Core]]. They lack evidence, so an undercover operation to the banquet is necessary, since the jewelry is claimed to be a gift for his wife on their anniversary.

In Rafayel's villa, he gives [[MC]] her "reward"--a mask for the masquerade banquet (and the invitation). He's already arranged identities for them. MC will be his manager, bodyguard, and assistant, and he'll be an opera singer. ((This is a reference to [[Siren's Song]], where [[Rafayel]] is an opera singer in [[Verona]].))

Three days later, they're at the banquet on a luxurious yacht. [[Rafayel]] give MC a hard time about standing too far away and looking too much like an "assassin".

A man in a Jester mask ([[Jester]]) approaches them. [[MC]] notes that [[Rafayel]]'s mannerisms have changed flawlessly to match his new identity. The man notices that the mask and brooch were actually made for someone named [[Yosef]], who's over 70. Rafayel is ready with an answer--he claims he's attending on the elderly man's behalf. [[Jester]] remains suspicious of them.

[[Maxwell]] announces that the main celebration will occur the following day, when they reach the private island. [[Jester]] retreats. MC asks if it's time for Plan B, and [[Rafayel]] agrees, telling her to follow his lead.
