There's a lot of lore surrounding MC's ability to resurrect, both within and across worlds, so this page collects explanations and analyses of this phenomenon in one place.

# MC's Birth
> "You were born in the depths of deepspace."
> -- [[Gaia Researcher]], [[05-01.01 New Objective]]

> "It began in 2034, when humanity received a faint signal from Deepspace. Once it was decoded, it revealed a story about a planet's quest for immortality. An ordinary planet achieved immortality by harnessing an inexhaustible cosmic energy source. They inspired us. And so, we conducted an experiment using collisions to recreate this inexhaustible cosmic energy. After several failed attempts, one proved to be a success. The energy manifested! However, no one expected it... to appear inside a child's body. And that child was you."
> -- [[Dimitri]], [[05-02.02 From Greatness to Madness]]:

MC manifested in the [[Gaia Research Center]] due to [[Ever]]'s experiments. [[Dimitri]] and [[Gaia Researcher]] both in some way claim her as an [[Ever]] "creation", but MC notes in [[05-02.04 Dust of Memories]]:
>  In the vast cosmos, my power has no starting point or destination. It appeared when the universe was created. It's a fundamental law etched into the fabric of existence.

So, their experiments effectively "summoned" her to the lab. As described in [[Josephine's secret notes]], she accidentally "died" while under observation, then came back to life later that day. The researchers voted to "kill" her a second time (with [[Grandma]] dissenting), releasing another burst of energy, starting the 3 day polar night that lead up to the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].

After the appearance of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], it seems that [[Dimitri]] tried to "kill" her a third time in an attempt to reverse the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. Based on the descriptions in [[05-02 All From Deepspace]], it's unclear whether Dimitri was successful before [[Sylus]] intervened and freed MC, allowing her to escape to the streets (where [[Xavier]] as [[Lumiere]] helps her) and eventually to the shelter where she meets [[Caleb]] and [[Zayne]].

MC's memory remained unstable for a while, according to [[Josephine's secret notes]], before eventually stabilizing.
# All From Deepspace
[[Dimitri]] didn't give up on his mission to try to destroy [[MC]] again, because he believes her existence will cause the destruction of the world. In [[05-02 All From Deepspace]], he lures her into the [[Deepspace Collision Chamber]] and attempts to use its antimatter properties to erase her energy.

This triggers another "death", and [[MC]] is able to "see" her own life energy in the form of a planet. It collapses into the [[Origo Core]] (as she dies) then approaches Earth again (described as a planet on the brink of destruction, see also [[cosmic cinematic#All From Deepspace]]) as she resurrects.

Note this passage especially, which describes MC's life force in the form of the [[Origo Core]]:
> Everything and nothing has changed.
> The [[Origo Core]] descends upon a planet nearing collapse.
> It's waiting for the end and its own birth.

Normally, she would lose all her memories and also forget this resurrection process. However, as shown in [[05-02.04 Dust of Memories]], [[Sylus and MC's Evol linkage]] is able to keep her "soul" bound to him. 

Her resurrection describes the process of her memories returning to her:
> *Suddenly, I "hear" a strong heartbeat and "feel" a warm power flow through me.*
> *It's a fragment from another place and time. Yet it brings a familiar presence. Everything that was lost has returned to me.*
> \[...]
> *Unfamiliar fragments connect into a single, unbroken thread. Those past experiences, emotions, choices, and missionsâ€”*
> *Once again, they cross the barriers of time and space.
> Carefully weaving themselves into the fabric of my existence, they become a part of me.*
> -- [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]]

The quote, "Everything and nothing has changed" seems to be a wink at a [ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) type situation: On the one hand, she's been totally reborn, her memories all re-made from her [[consciousness energy]] lingering across [[spacetime]]. On the other hand, with every piece back where it was, she's the same person she was when she "died".

# Across Myths
Things are a bit looser across myths, and MC's energy burst resurrection isn't observed in any other myths to-date. (July 2025) Generally, if she dies she dies, though she's usually able to be reincarnated, usually through association with the planet's core or an [[Aether Core]] (which are really the same type of thing, since [[Aether Core]]s are planetary cores.)

## Parents
While MC isn't always described as an orphan in myths, to-date (July 2025) none of the myths have explicitly described her as having biological parents. [[Shooting Stars]], the myth that's most related to [[Ever]]'s immortality experiments, describes her as being reborn from the core of the planet. Likewise, [[Sea of Golden Sand]] refers to how MC's energy sustains the planet.

## Resurrection
Sometimes, she resurrects within the same "world", such as how [[Tears of Romirro]] is a sequel to [[Forgotten Sea]].

## Aether Cores
Some myths directly reference other [[Aether Core]]s, such as [[Tower of Secrets]] and the [[Creatio Core]].
