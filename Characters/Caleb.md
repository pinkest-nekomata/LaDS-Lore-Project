# Timeline

# Academics
Caleb scored top marks in high school and consistently excelled at [[Aerospace Academy]], earning a "rising star" status. The only thing he ever scored poorly on was his mental health assessment. Though [[Caleb]]'s gravity Evol is a massive asset in dealing with the g forces of being a pilot, he doesn't slack in his studies.

# Relationship to MC
In all localizations except EN, [[Caleb]] is explicitly referred to as [[MC]]'s adopted brother. This trope of romance with an adopted/step-brother is more common in the CN, JP, and KN markets.

Only the EN avoids this term, only ever calling him a "childhood friend". This is a fairly superficial decision, as they were raised together from MC's age 7/8 and Caleb's age 9/10, and it leaves some quirks in the EN localization. There's also a fair amount of step-brother romance in the EN market, though not as commonly as in the other markets.

Notably, before [[04 Homecoming Wings]] released, players received an in-game message from Linkon city hall. In the CN, JP, and KN markets, this message said that the legal relative status between MC, [[Grandma]], and [[Caleb]] was severed upon them being declared dead, making them technically no longer siblings. The EN message just mentioned picking up the death certificates, and not the relational status.
