> The Connoisseur's Menu is the most infamous menu in the [[N109 Zone]]. It's second to none. Not only do its dishes draw inspiration from the area's most celebrated eras and figures, but... it also doubles as a top-secret ledger for "intel trading" and "deals with high stakes".
> -- [[WU-14 Elysium]].

A special menu available at [[Elysium]]:
> **Elysium Connoisseur's Menu** (Test Menu)
> -- Fill your empty soul to your heart's content

> "Now you may place your order. Every dish comes with its own special seasonings so our customers can choose what suits their palate."
> -- [[Aislinn]], [[WU-14 Elysium#03 Coward's Shell]]

Each menu item below contains the description from [[WU-14 Elysium]] and additional quotes/commentary.

# Do It
> **House special blend. One-third whiskey, two scoops of cream, one brown sugar cube, and a sprinkle of fate.** (Complimentary)
> Description: Every gift comes with a hidden price. But this coffee is actually free. "Do It" can be a command or an expression of encouragement.
> Then again, some say to ignore people and do whatever you want.

> [[Phantom Thief Pea]]: "Do it? Is this some kind of go-getter philosophy for life?"
> [[Aislinn]]: "Oh? So that's how people interpret it."

> [[Phantom Thief Pea]]: "Cough, cough... Who puts booze in coffee?!"
> [[Aislinn]]: \[...] "That's our signature blend."

## Commentary
This is an [Irish Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_coffee), and there are many Irish and Italian references through the [[N109 Zone]] lore to hint at common mobster and gang tropes. 1/3 whiskey is a typical ratio, albeit on the stronger side.

# Mobster's Salad
> **Mashed potatoes, eggs, fresh shrimp, chickpeas, and yogurt, all crushed together with desire.**
> (5, 6, 7, 8)
> Description: They came here to survive. They drowned in their own greed. To those ruthless criminals we lost forever. Without them... The [[N109 Zone]] wouldn't be what it is today. Although they're no longer here to see it.

## Commentary
This one doesn't immediately resemble a real-world recipe, though making mashed potatoes with chickpeas and greek yogurt isn't unheard of. Potatoes could be a wink at the Irish, while chickpeas represent the mediterranean/Italian element.

# Coward's Shell
> **Fresh oysters, lemon juice, ground pepper, and a dash of courage.**
> (1, 3, 4)
> Description: Without their sturdy shelter, the spineless remain spineless. That is why we built our foundation from the strongest materials. This dish honors those misfits who once graced our establishment. Without them, [[Elysium]] would never exist. Some exiles become worthless junk, and others transform into pearls. Is it the environment that determines their fate? Or their own nature?

## Commentary
Talk of cowards reminds [[Aislinn]] of the thugs that came to demand protection payments from [[Elysium]], which she and [[Ginevra]] promptly beat up and kicked out. Interestingly, the remark "that's why we built our foundation from the strongest materials" seems to imply that a sturdy foundation enables courage, as a shell might. [[Dexter]] makes a remark that they can't be cowards now when he goes on his ill-fated mission to try to recover a missing child. This one perhaps honors the "misfits" like [[Dexter]].

# The N109 Grand Platter
> **Venison from acorn-fed deer, white truffle cheese, white caviar, and blue lobster tart with mango. Complimentary to the true VIPs.** 
> (3, 5)
> Description: Four distinct powers dominate the [[N109 Zone]]. They are the true players at the N109 Zone's gambling table. A platter of four rare delicacies. They don't compliment each other. They're just equally expensive. Choose wisely. If you're unsure, try them one at a time.
* Special services:
	* (3) Infiltration
	* (5) Mediation

## Commentary
The four powers are [[Sylus]] and the three gangs that were in charge before the [[2036 Disaster]]. Presumably, the remnants of those gangs continue, but don't challenge [[Onychinus]]. The specials of infiltration and mediation hint at tense power dynamics and spies. It's not immediately clear which food corresponds to which group, or if that's even intended.

True to the description, each of the mentioned foods is a real-world delicacy:
* 'Acorn-fed deer' is a reference to a fattened, well-fed deer as acorns are a preferred food source for bulking up for the winter months ([Wildtree](https://wildtree.co/blog/acorns-deer-food/#:~:text=Acorns%20are%20highly%20nutritious%2C%20filled,eat%2C%20the%20fatter%20they%20are.)).
* Truffles are rare and highly sought after for their flavor, none moreso than the white truffle, which is native to Italy ([Sabatino 1911](https://sabatino1911.com/blogs/trufflepedia/all-about-white-truffles#:~:text=White%20Truffles%20are%20the%20rarest,aromas%20of%20any%20truffle%20species.)).
* White caviar comes only from albino sturgeon, making it even more rare and expensive than the already-notorious black caviar ([Fine Dining Lovers](https://www.finedininglovers.com/explore/articles/white-caviar-costs-over-30000-kilo)).
* Blue lobsters are a rare genetic mutation, something like 1 in 1-2 million ([All That's Interesting](https://allthatsinteresting.com/blue-lobster)). Mango isn't particularly rare, but orange compliments blue nicely.

# 24k Exchange Artist
> **Chicken leg cooked with scallion oil, soy sauce, salt, golden coconut oil, sesame oil, shredded ginger, and scallions. Comes with a dash of humor.**
> (1, 2, 4, 6)
> Description: He's no thief. He's an artist who believes in a fair exchange! Dedicated to the unseen [[Phantom Thief Pea]]. Everything has a price. Pain is traded for an equal amount of pain. Joy is exchanged for an equal amount of joy. But is your happiness truly equal to mine?

## Commentary
This listing sheds light on [[Phantom Thief Pea]] himself, and we see him do one of these "exchanges" in [[WU-14 Elysium#01 Meeting]]. It's also why he ends up trading a sum of cash not even enough to buy a decent bullet for the priceless [[Protocore map]] during the [[2036 Disaster]].

Note that a chicken leg is simple, homey food. Scallions represent spring, good luck, and new beginnings in Chinese culture ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/style/symbolic-foods-of-the-chinese-new-year.html)). Likewise, Ginger represents good health and longevity ([White Rabbit Institute](https://www.whiterabbitinstituteofhealing.com/herbs/ginger/)) and its golden color can be connected to wealth and luck. Not also the "golden" coconut oil.

In essence, this is a homey, familiar dish filled with wishes for prosperity and longevity, a friendly and warm nod to the beloved thief.

# The Point of No Return
> **Smoked pigeon, saffron, pickled onions, barley, toasted truffle bread with au jus, and 100% trust.**
> (5, 7, 8)
> Description: At Charon, no deal goes unmade. The "pigeon" meat from the market's "arena". A rare delicacy available only this season. Pay the appropriate fee. And they will fulfill your every wish. Remember... once a deal is in place, there's no turning back.

	* (8) Proxy Deals

## Commentary
Charon is the ferryman to the underworld in ancient greek mythology ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon)), underscoring that the "point of no return" here is death. The "arena" could refer to the [[N109 Zone]]'s [[fighting arena]]. This one clearly connects to taking out a hit (ie having someone killed).

# Strawberry Disaster Special
> **Strawberry ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry sauce, chocolate-covered strawberries, chili powder made from the Red Savina pepper, and a four-leaf clover.**
> (7)
> Description: If you survived 2036... The gang war that engulfed the N109 Zone... This is the dessert you can't refuse. Rich ice cream wrapped in strawberry sauce... and spiced with chili to sting your tongue. Like that night, when the streets ran red... Not all survivors were strong, and not all the strong survived. Wouldn't you agree, you lucky duck?

## Commentary
Strawberry's bright read evokes pools of blood. The Red Savina pepper is notable for its particularly high spiciness and "Chinese Lantern" shape ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Savina_pepper)), while the four-leaf clover represents the luck involved in who survived (since strength alone was not enough).

# Today's Special: Sweet Evil Trap
> **Pepper walnut tart, rosemary gelato, pomegranate jelly, red wine marshmallow, and 10.5 grams of soul.**
> (0)
> Description: I'm waiting for you.

## Commentary
[[Sylus]]'s message for [[MC]].

[[Sylus]] is strongly implied to still be the "sponsor" of [[Elysium]] and the "powerful force" behind it. [[Aislinn]] specifically mentions that the "sponsor" is the "side dish" for this menu item, and that it's for only one person--a "certain lady". There's only one person [[Sylus]] would leave a message like this for--[[MC]]. Especially when you break down the symbolism of the ingredients:

* Walnuts were prized in Ancient Greece as the "royal nut" ([Hoplite Association](https://www.hoplites.org/food-of-the-ancient-greeks/)) and they retain their reputation as an aphrodisiac ([Diane Kochilas](https://www.dianekochilas.com/three-walnut-honey-aphrodisiac-greek-recipes-for-valentines-day/)), complemented by pepper's heat and pleasurable pain. 
* Rosemary symbolizes remembrance, loyalty, love and protection ([Symbol Sage](https://symbolsage.com/rosemary-herb-meaning/))
* **Pomegranate** evokes the forbidden fruit ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_fruit#Pomegranate)) and the underworld trap that snared Persephone ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone#Abduction_myth)). 
* A **red wine marshmallow** recalls an effort to quench an insatiable thirst ([[02-01.05 Desire]])
* Plus half a **soul**
	* The 10.5 grams is a reference to the idea that a soul weighs 21 grams ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_grams_experiment)), so 10.5 is exactly half. (They trade half their souls in [[Beyond Cloudfall]].)

The message, "I'm waiting for you", seems to hint that this is a romantic gesture during the time before Sylus and MC reconnect.
