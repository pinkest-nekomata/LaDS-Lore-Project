"Wanderers are everywhere. Literally. I even heard there's one that's sorta like a lemon. Am I wrong?" -- [[Rafayel]], [[01-02.09 Coral Stone Mystery]]

# Spacepedia
These monsters are made from [[Metaflux]]. They first appeared from the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] in various forms. While most species lack intelligence, they are formidable. They attach humans and animals and are not easy to defeat.

# Other Info

### Threat Rank
C-B are approachable for rookies
A are dangerous
S and higher are very dangerous

## Detection
* The [[Hunter's Watch]] can pick up on the [[Metaflux]] fluctuations that Wanderers cause and are attracted to. MC's [[Resonance Evol]] is even more sensitive at picking these traces up.
* Wanderers can cause lights to flicker, and cause MC to experience invisible pressure. ([[01-02.03 Powder Keg]])

## Types
* [[Intelligentia Type]]

## Traits
* Lower rank [[Wanderer]]s do not have [[Protocore]]s--these form only in stronger Wanderers. ([[01-02.05 Artsy Dreams]], Spacepedia [[Protocore]] page.)
