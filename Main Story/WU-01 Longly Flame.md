[[Dr. Noah]] reflects on [[Zayne]]'s history as a student and researcher.

## Summary
Zayne accepts [[William]]'s martyr medal from [[Sienna]], who can't bear to look at it.

[[Dr. Noah]] reflects on his time with [[Zayne]], especially [[Zayne's research]] at [[Skyhaven University]] Medical school.
* Part of why [[Zayne]] is working so hard is for "her", [[MC]], so he's not helpless the next time he becomes a threat to her
* [[Zayne]] was doing research on using [[Protocore]] Energy for interventional cardiology, but destroyed his data when [[black crystals]] took over a patient's heart.

Autumn 2047 is [[Dr. Noah]]'s last first year oath ceremony before he retires and heads to the [[Arctic]]. At this time, [[Zayne]] hasn't met up with [[MC]] again yet, though he's preparing to take over her case from [[Dr. Noah]]. That actual case transfer is described in [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs#05 Snow Depth]].


# 01 The One Left
((As confirmed in chapter 05 below, it is autumn 2047.))

[[William]]'s girlfriend [[Sienna]] delivers a box to [[Zayne]] containing [[William]]'s martyr's badge. She's unable to accept it, finding it easier to imagine that he's still out on a mission and will be home soon. Zayne solemnly accepts the badge, tucking it into a drawer.

[[Sienna]] references how [[Dr. Noah]] and [[Zayne]] would always visit [[Skyhaven University]] during first-year admissions. [[William]] was always too busy to go, so she asks [[Zayne]] to tell [[Dr. Noah]] that [[William]] said hi.

# 02 Review
((Autumn 2047 ceremony, as confirmed in chapter 05 below.))

[[Dr. Noah]], who will retire soon, waits at the entrance to [[Skyhaven University]] on the first day of school. [[Zayne]] greets him. [[Dr. Noah]] comments on how it's always been the two of them on the trip because [[William]] was too busy. Now, [[Zayne]] is too busy, so he wonders who will come with him next year. He makes a vague comment about "that boy, [[Carter]]", then dismisses the thought.

[[Zayne]] say states that [[William]] sends his regards ((as [[Sienna]] asked him to)) and promises to accompany [[Dr. Noah]] for every year in the future.

((Reading between the lines, it's unclear if [[Dr. Noah]] isn't aware of [[William]]'s death or they're dancing around it. [[Zayne]]'s commitment to continue to join [[Dr. Noah]] is clearly him expressing care and an understanding of how precious that time is, especially when confronted with [[William]]'s mortality.))

They proceed into the campus auditorium, where a banner reads "47th First-Year Medical Student Oath Ceremony". An eager student approaches them, asking to take a picture.

> Eager student: You're the legendary 35th academic god that we all pray to before exams!

[[Dr. Noah]] reflects that when [[Zayne]] took the oath, he was younger than everyone else, yet his composed and steady demeanor impressed Dr. Noah.

Commenting on the excitement, [[Dr. Noah]] says how [[William]] and [[Carter]] were like this too... then brushes away the thought. He teases [[Zayne]] about the rumor of the ghost in the office. Zayne brushes it off as superstition, but in the next chapter it's revealed that Zayne's own late night study habits are responsible.

# 03 Heart
[[Dr. Noah]] thinks back to the year 2040 (eight years before the main story begins). He's receiving positive feedback about [[Zayne]]'s hard work so far. Here, we get some hints about [[Zayne's research]]--he's created a theoretical model for [[Protocore]] use.

In the newly renovated cafeteria, he overhears a security guard talking about suspicious experiences in the research labs at night. Then [[Zayne]] arrives, and they talk about next steps for [[Zayne's research]]. [[Dr. Noah]] comments on how he's been working so hard he missed an exam, and to not wear himself out. But [[Zayne]] insists he's not tired.

> This child was too mature for his age and carried too much on his shoulders.

Later, when [[Dr. Noah]] is wrapping up for the night, he sees [[Zayne]] reading late in his office. Since he's hidden from the door, the security guard turns off the lights, and then is startled when Zayne turns them on again. This explains the "ghost". 

Dr Noah leads Zayne out of the lab, pressing him about why he works so hard and mentioning that both Zayne's parents were doctors. Dr Noah suspects there's more to it, but Zayne quickly dismisses the idea--too quickly.

> "It's also... because of... someone. I don't want to be incapable of doing anything again when I become a threat to her."
> --[[Zayne]], [[WU-01 Longly Flame#03 Heart]]

# 04 Oath
A few days later, the deal of the medical school calls in [[Dr. Noah]]. [[Zayne]] is already there. Zayne has destroyed his part of the experimental data. Even though it doesn't hurt anyone else, the dean is perplexed since this will set back [[Zayne's research]].

[[Carter]] starts to say something ("As long as we re--"), but [[Dr. Noah]] cuts him off, saying he'll handle it and the students can be let go. ((It seems Carter was about to say they can recreate the data in future experiments.))

Afterwards, [[Dr. Noah]] and [[Zayne]] talk. Dr Noah also told the dean how [[Zayne]] wants to leave the research group. Dr Noah praises Zayne's bravery to abandon research he's already put so much work into. Zayne reveals that he deleted the data because during experimentation, [[black crystals]] grew on/in a patients heart. (Full details in the [[Zayne's research]] page.)

# 05 Trek
[[Dr. Noah]] then returns to the autumn of 2047 ((i.e. the same time as chapter 02 above)), and the 47th oath ceremony. Dr Noah talks about how he'll leave [[Linkon]] when he retires. (In [[01-05 Eternal Aurora]], we see that he moved to [[Snowcrest]].)

> Dr Noah remembers something important. "Have you visited her yet?"
> Zayne pauses. Then he says, "Not yet."
> "Are you afraid?"
> "No." He shakes his head, his voice steady.

Dr Noah watches [[Zayne]] leave [[Akso Hospital]] for the night.

> He remembers that night when a single light glowed in the campsite during a blizzard in the [[Arctic]]. He remembered the lonely figure leaving in the cold wind the next day when the experiment's data were destroyed. Perhaps the path the young man walks has only heavy snow and level ground. He's destined to walk alone. As his teacher, Dr Noah can only hope that one day a fork in the road will appear before the young man, offering him tranquil respite.
