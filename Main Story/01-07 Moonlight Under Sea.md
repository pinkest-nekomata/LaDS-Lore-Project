# Summary
[[MC]] uses [[Xavier]]'s elevated access to find an informant to give her additional intel. She identifies a suspicious murder from two years ago of an [[Ever]] researcher. The audio file she gets confirms that [[Sylus]] was behind the murder, looking for intel on [[Ever]], but she doesn't recognize his voice yet. The anonymous informant also tells her about a new bounty--on [[Rafayel]].

She then goes to check on [[Rafayel]], and he's fine. He already knows about the bounty. Someone suspicious is following them, but it turns out to be a journalist from [[Weekly Arts]] who's just trying to get the scoop. The collector [[Raymond]] just died the night before under suspicious circumstances. He apparently drowned in his bathtub after carving a fish scale pattern into his skin.

[[Rafayel]] tries to collect on his bodyguard deal with [[MC]], but when she goes to leave anyway, he sweetens the deal by offering to help her get into the [[N109 Zone]]. She agrees to help him out for the intel, and the next day they head to [[Hat Island]].

On the island, [[Rafayel]] coaches [[MC]] to resonate with the stone. It doesn't achieve what he was hoping, but does attract some lurking [[Wanderer]]s. It's only when a stray cat draws [[Rafayel]]'s blood that his target appears--the [[Deluge Wyrmlord]].

In the process of defeating it, [[MC]] ends up underwater. She has a flashback to a promise she made to [[Rafayel]]--one she's since forgotten. She calls out to [[Rafayel]] with her mind, and he saves her, taking on his [[Lemurian]] form in the process, though MC doesn't know about it.
