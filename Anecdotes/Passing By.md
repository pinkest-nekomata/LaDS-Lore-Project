# Anecdote
Relevant LI: [[Xavier]]
Main POV character: [[Arthur]], [[Xavier]]
Associated Companion: [[Xavier - Evol Police]]

Before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], [[Xavier]] bonded with a misfit team in the [[Evol Police]].

## Summary
This anecdote details [[Xavier]]'s time as an [[Evol Police]] officer in the years 2032-2033. This is one of many identities he had over the years--but the first time he left a mark in someone else's story.

Initially, [[Xavier]] is hired as a new recruit to [[Team 013]]. The disgraced team has been relegated to the records room, which allows [[Xavier]] access to old files, which he'll eventually use to help out one of the [[Backtrackers]], [[Noah]].

Xavier tries to keep a low profile, but endears himself to the small team. [[Arthur]] is the captain and [[Tommy]] and [[Luke]] are the officers. He tries to keep to his desk, but ends up becoming the team's "good luck charm" as he secretly apprehends criminals and delivers them to the team. 

He then fakes his own death and has a brief encounter with [[Isaiah]] before vanishing again. His next stop will be to see [[Jeremiah]], as detailed in [[WU-04 From The Stars]].

Twelve years later, he visits his own grave and runs into [[Arthur]] there, who still remembers him--though not for long, since he's having memory issues. It allows [[Arthur]] to keep [[Xavier]]'s secret, though, and both appreciate the reunion.

## Commentary
We get some helpful information about the [[Backtrackers]] here, especially that [[Noah]] was one of those who went on to live a mundane life. Noah mentions how there were issues with the "slipspace" during the [[Traceback II]]'s travel, and it couldn't handle the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]'s fluctuations.

There's also an encounter with [[Isaiah]], one of the traitors of the [[Backtrackers]]. He feels like [[Xavier]] betrayed them, meanwhile in [[WU-04 From The Stars]] [[Jeremiah]] feels like [[Xavier]]'s the only one who's kept their true mission in mind.

# 01 Team 013
> Sixteen Years Ago. Spring. Prior to [[Arthur]]'s memory decaying to a point where he couldn't remember anything.
* 2032, a little over two years before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]

It's shortly after the lunar new year. [[Bloomshore District]]'s special task force, [[Team 013]], is welcoming their first new recruit in five years. He has the rare [[Light Evol]], but only does utility and scouting work. [[Luke]] and [[Tommy]] discuss how their department is a dead end.

[[Arthur]] hears this with mixed emotions. He's been a police officer for sixteen years and captain of this team for nine. An injury five years ago knocked him off track, but now that he's recovered, he wants to use this new recruit to refresh the team.

[[Xavier]] arrives as the new rookie, claiming to be 23. Slowly, Tommy and Luke warm to him. They ask why he requested the transfer to their department, and he says it's to go through all the old archives they have access to.

On a mission, Xavier was injured while rescuing someone. He spent two weeks in the hospital, then claims he never meant to rescue that person and the experience traumatized him. After he recovers, he requests to do desk work for the team instead of field work.
* ((Reading between the lines, what actually happens here is that Xavier realizes that while he's out doing field work, it's going to be harder for him to hide his skill, since he's not going to be able to leave people un-rescued. So, by switching to desk work, he can keep to himself.))

> Like a forgotten cactus on the window sill, Xavier lives a simple life, thriving amidst the winds and the sun's harsh glare.

# 02 An Unspoken Secret
Xavier keeps to himself, though he does subtly use his Evol like a flashbang to help apprehend criminals.

Their next mission is someone they've gone after before--an Evol hallucinogen dealer named [[Lawrence]] who works in [[Linkon]] City and [[Skyhaven]]. This case is a last chance for [[Team 013]] to redeem themselves--if they fail, they'll be disbanded. They draw straws to see who will go undercover to the newly opened [[Palace Bathouse]], and [[Tommy]] "wins". He begs not to be selected, and [[Arthur]] even agrees, thinking he's not attractive enough and would be suspicious. "If you looked like Xavier..." The plan comes together.
* ((The Bathhouse is essentially a fancy spa, so they want all the employees to be young and attractive. Xavier is good looking enough to get hired on that alone.))

[[Xavier]] goes undercover, using the name "Bob" to try to get a job. The bathhouse's owner, Roman, decides he should go by "Christian" instead and hires him. Xavier soon gets an opportunity to meet [[Lawrence]], who's there for a massage. 

[[Xavier]] pretends to start the massage, then uses his knowledge of pressure points to pin [[Lawrence]] down with extreme pain and ask about his supply. Lawrence cries out, and his guards come in to stop Xavier. But Xavier reveals the strength of his Evol at this point, knocking them all out and holding Lawrence at sword-point. When [[Luke]] arrives to help, Xavier plays dumb, and pins the victory on [[Luke]].

Two weeks later, there's a commendation ceremony, where [[Luke]] awkwardly takes credit for [[Xavier]]'s work. After that, a string of mysterious apprehensions occurs. Criminals are found tired up outside the station, or confess on livestreams. ((This is implied to be [[Xavier]]'s doing.))

The team has found their fighting spirit again. Tommy and Luke are offered transfers, but refuse, chalking their success up to luck. And [[Xavier]] is their good luck charm. There's an unspoken agreement to keep his secret.

# 03 A Familiar Face
It's new years again, and the team gathers at the office for a potluck dinner.

Xavier steps outside, and [[Arthur]] joins him. Arthur reveals that he noticed a missing file from the archive, about "an event that happened decades ago. The involved party is long gone, and the office gave up looking into it." Arthur then got Xavier's personal files from HQ, and they were spotless. ((I think this is meant to imply Arthur was checking if Xavier had been caught stealing files before? Or if he had any connection to the missing file?))

Arthur reveals he found a match in the "portrait database":
> In the faded, yellowed photograph are the traces of a man with silver hair. His figure is tall, slender. All that remains is a blurry white silhouette.

Arthur says they all have their own secrets, and he hopes [[Xavier]] chooses to stay on the team. ((ie he's not going to go after him for stealing the file or keeping secrets.))

As the new year fireworks go off, [[Xavier]] muses that it's time for him to leave.

# 04 Old Friend
[[Xavier]] slips the missing file into a mailbox, feeds the stray cats nearby, then heads back to his apartment. He has a text conversation with [[Noah]]:

> Noah: Aren't you going to ask what I'm going to do with this?
> *Xavier had told him to come to his house to pick up the file.*
> Xavier: That's ur business
> [...]
> Noah: I want to use this for a new identity.
> Noah: I just want to be an ordinary person in this timeline.
> Noah: ... Are you still there? Do you think it's funny? I don't blame you, though. I agree.
> [...]
> Xavier: [...] But U fell in love with some1 here
> Noah: ...
> Xavier: Theres nothing wrong with that
> Noah: Enough about me. Are you really going to wait for that person?
> Xavier: Yeah
> Noah: How long are you going to wait? 10? 100? Or 1000 years?
> Noah: Something messed with the slipsace during the Backtrack. The spaceship couldn't handle the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] fluctuations.
> Noah: Both she and the [[Aether Core]] vanished without a trace. For all we know, they might already be cosmic dust.
> Xavier: I know
> Noah: Even if you press on, you're not going to get the outcome you're hoping for.
* The "she" here is [[MC]]. ((However, she wasn't actually on the [[Traceback II]]--[[Queen MC]] was left behind on the planet. So, this comment is still a bit intriguing.))
* "Backtrack" refers to their journey back in time (see also [[Backtrackers]])

Fireworks go off. [[Xavier]] goes and activates the intercom, telling [[Noah]] that the file's in the mailbox and he can take it from there. Noah is startled that [[Xavier]] guessed he was already there. Xavier says goodbye, but Noah offers one last warning: "Be careful. They're going to find you."

# 05 The Road's End
[[Xavier]] reflects on how lingering in one place too long leaves noticable traces. There's a fire, which we learn at the end of the chapter is due to an explosion in a factory in the southern part of [[Linkon]].

Xavier decides to "die" in the fire. The factory, "which appears much like a military base," is where a criminal was hiding. He takes the ID off an unconscious man and throws his baton in the corner. Sirens go off as the fire spreads.
* ((The unconscious man is the criminal [[Grey Hawk]]. Later it's confirmed that they find [[Xavier]]'s gun and identification, so I'm not entirely sure what to make of the phrasing here, but it's not too consequential.))

As he goes to leave, a young girl with a dirty rabbit plushie cries at a street corner. Xavier stops to try to comfort her and send her home. Across the street, another young man with silver hair  ([[Isaiah]]) spots him--he appears slightly younger. He comments on how [[Xavier]] has been eluding them by hiding in plain sight.
* (This is the pursuer that [[Noah]] warned him about.)

This man accuses [[Xavier]] of abandoning [[Team 013]] just like he abandoned the [[Backtrackers]]. He then wonders how [[Xavier]] will erase their traces this time. With a flash of light, [[Xavier]] teleports away. The mysterious man draws his own light blade.
* ((These are the same traits as  [[duckbill cap man]], but silver hair and the light Evol are not as rare among those from [[Philos]], so I need to cross-check this against [[Shooting Stars]]. In [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]] there's a reference to [[Isaiah]] already being dead, but it's fully 6mo after the explosion, so this tracks.  #todo))

Xavier sets the girl down in an alley, hiding their footprints, and urging her to head home. He leaves the alley.

Xavier draws all the surrounding light to himself--the street lights, search lights, even the skyscraper lights--plunging the area of the city into darkness. The other man's name is revealed to be [[Isaiah]] as he confronts [[Xavier]]. Xavier says, "You've never managed to beat me in the past." [[Isaiah]] insists things are different now.

"You can guess how I'll erase our traces," Xavier says, and releases the light, sending a brilliant flash and streaks like shooting stars across the sky.

[[Arthur]] gets an alert about the explosion. They got a tip that a dangerous criminal, [[Grey Hawk]] is there and they find him shivering in the snow. When he arrives, [[Arthur]] finds out that [[Xavier]] was "trapped" in the fire. They find his gun and ID, and declare him dead in winder of 2033, having sacrificed himself on a solo mission to apprehend the wanted criminal [[Grey Hawk]].

(([[Xavier]] is with [[Jeremiah]] by summer of 2033, as detailed in [[WU-04 From The Stars]].))

# 06 The Passing Spring
Spring, 2045. 11 years after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], 12 years after [[Xavier]]'s "death".

[[Xavier]] is at the cemetary that holds his tombstone from his time with [[Team 013]]. Since they were a special task force, their graves are confidential, including only their police ID. Over time, he's seen numbers appear belonging to people he remembered.

The turnout at his funeral was modest, but everyone was crying. Arthur, Tommy and Luke all showed an uncharacteristic amount of emotion.
> It's a peculiar feeling, as if part of his life is buried beneath the tombstone despite it being empty. [...] the unfamiliarity of being remembered for the first time by those who should not remember him. It's like a traveler, after many years, returns to the place from which he departed, only to discover someone is still gazing at the spot where he vanished.

[[Xavier]] buys flowers to put on the graves. [[Arthur]] happens to be there at the same time, though he's elderly now and being pushed in a wheelchair by his granddaughter. He recognizes Xavier instantly, but the granddaughter apologizes that he's having memory issues, then asks if she can take their picture together, since he's also a "relative of a police officer". Xavier agrees.

> "I may be old, but my memory isn't as frail as you might think," the eldery man in the wheelchair says slowly. "Long time no see."
> "Long time no see."
> "Don't worry. I won't remember you for long." He laughs and coughs, gasping for breath several times. "In a few more years, when people ask about Xavier, I'll have forgotten about you."

The granddaughter takes the photo.

> After many years, he finally leaves a bit of himself in someone else's story.

The granddaughter offers a copy, but [[Xavier]] declines. They wish each other a happy new year, then depart.
