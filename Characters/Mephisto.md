# Spacepedia
A mechanical crow that always accompanies Sylus. He's very skilled but has a temper. Sylus doesn't treat him as a pet.

# Other Info
In at least one [[Moments]] post, Sylus confirms that he did not program all of Mephisto's traits. Many of them are normal crow traits. This implies that [[Mephisto]] is more of a cyborg than a purely robotic creature.

First appearance: In [[No-Hunt Zone 7]], during [[01-03.08 Where Light Vanishes]]
* So, [[Sylus]] knew some of [[MC]]'s whereabouts before she arrived in the [[N109 Zone]]
* He also knows she can resonate with the [[Flux Nexus]] and retrieve the [[Protocore]] inside
* He could have been tracking her, [[Xavier]], the fluctuations, the no-hunt zone generally, or the [[Flux Nexus]].

## Apperance
Mephisto is the shape and size of a normal crow, and moves like one. His eyes appear to be made of rubies and glow from within. He has a metal plate over his head, across his back, and on the leading edges of his wings. His claws are described as being metal.

## Abilities
In [[02-01.02 Alike]], [[Mephisto]] is shown to be able to also dissolve into mist and reappear. ((It's unclear whether he can do this of his own accord or whether he requires Sylus to be there and using his Evol.))

* A very high IQ ([[Classified Intel - N109 Zone]])
* Metal claws ([[02-02.01 Alone]])
* Razor-sharp wings ([[02-01.04 Into Danger]], [[02-02.02 Night Raid]])

# Name's origin
"Mephisto" is a reference to Mephistopholes, the demon that makes a deal with Faust in German folklore. The name itself is a corrupted Greek compound, potentially meaning "hater of light". The demon seeks out those who are already on corrupted paths, and though his job is to facilitate deals with the devil, he warns the damned against it. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephistopheles))

Greek names are a common theme in Sylus's lore--see also [[Onychinus#Meaning]].
