One of [[Caleb]]'s dorm-mates at [[Aerospace Academy]]. Gets motion sick during gravity training.

He was born into a family of fighter pilots and gets top marks on theory but poor marks in practice. He's a bit jealous of [[Caleb]]'s seemingly effortless excellence. So, he pretends not to care. ([[Pathless Realm#02 Dreams]])

# Commentary
Timonthy's persistent and frustrating motion sickness is actually reflective of real-world struggles that fighter pilots and astronauts have ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_adaptation_syndrome)). Some people, no matter how fit or disciplined, just get violently ill under these conditions. It's even forced astronauts to finish missions early. For these driven individuals, who see any challenge as something they can rise to, this seemingly unchangeable physical limitation is incredibly frustrating. Though Timothy's frustration could be read as immature, in this light, it's tragic and deeply understandable.
