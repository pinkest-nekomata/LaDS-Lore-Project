# Details
[[MC]] confronts [[Rafayel]] about the coral stone being imbued with [[Metaflux]], demanding to know where he got it.

He's cagey at first, saying it's not something you can just buy, and guessing at where he might have gotten it. Then, he reaches into his desk to pull out his collection log. He appears to flip past another book and quickly glances to make sure MC didn't see, hiding that book and getting the log.

[[Rafayel]] barters for her to be his bodyguard. If she helps him find suitable replacement stones, he'll allow her to have the [[collection log]] with the origin of the mysterious [[coral stone]]. ((This is likely just a scheme to get her to spend time with him.))
