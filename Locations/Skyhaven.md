aka Skyhaven Guard Station Archipelago, actually a series of islands.

# Spacepedia
Skyhaven is an artificial floating island hovering near [[Linkon]] City. A [[Protocore]] serves as its primary energy source. It is home to the most cutting-edge research centers and advanced tech organizations such as the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]].

* [[Skyrise Isle]]

# Locations

Known locations:
* [[Skyhaven University]]
* [[Skyhaven Ring]]
	* Encircles the highest [[Guard Station]], which is the [[Farspace Fleet command center]].
* Various Guard Stations
* [[Skyhaven Elementary]]
* [[Caleb's place]]
* [[Cascade District]]
	* [[Villa Area 6]]
* [[Willow Medical Center]]
* [[Skyhaven School of Medicine]]

# Other Info
* Home to [[Aerospace Academy]], which feeds the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]].
* Due to its altitude, it doesn't have much wildlife--even birds are a rare sight ([[WU-15 Sketches Vol 13#02 Homeland]]).
* The islands float due to disturbances caused by the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], while a [[Protocore]] energy source keeps the islands stable.
	* The [[Farspace Fleet]] controls this energy source, giving them substantial authority. ([[04-01.01 Infiltration]])

# Origin

From [[WU-15 Sketches Vol 13]]:
> In 2034, intense magnetic [[fluctuation]]s from the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] caused several islands and landmasses to break away from their tectonic plates, drawn together and suspended above [[Linkon]] City by an unusual [[gravity vortex]].
> In 2036, building on their initial success with [[Protocore]] technology, [[EVER]] corporation boldly proposed the "Skyhaven Project"--a plan to stabilize these floating islands using high-intensity [[Protocore]]s, establish self-sustaining ecosystems, and connect surrounding Guard Stations to creat a true "aerial base", pioneering new ground for human habitation.

One such island was [[Whirlreef Island]], former home of [[Yvette]], which is circular due to the island freely spinning in its lake. This island contained many research institutes.

The "Skyhaven Project" was controversial--"Purists" opposed the project due to concerns about [[Wanderer]]s and [[Protocore Syndrome]] while "Prototists" saw it as the future of humanity. "[[Cloud]]" was a large driver of public support for the project.
