**Description**
> I discovered a bucket list I wanted to do with a person I liked. Seeing that there were so many items not done, I decided to begin checking them off one by one.

# Summary
MC finds a notebook from her youth with her "Bucket List After Finding the Person I Like". In starting to complete some of the items by herself, like seeing a horror movie, she runs into Xavier. They decide to watch the sunrise together and discuss the list and the criteria she'd set for a "perfect boyfriend" when she was a kid.

After they go fill a cart with plushies from a crane machine, Xavier offers to accompany MC on more of the items that require two people. She interprets this as a "sign" from the universe about finding the right person.

MC and Xavier are not yet dating in this memory.

# Key Info
* Xavier says he sleeps all day and can't sleep at night.
	* He goes to the theater for midnight showings regularly to entertain himself. He's clearly seen this movie before.
* When she was young, MC made a "Bucket List After Finding the Person I Like". Items include:
	* Join the longest like at a food stall together
	* Give each other a handmade gift
	* Watch a horror movie together
	* Watch the sunrise together
* The next item on the list after "watch the sunrise together" is filling a cart with plushies from a claw machine. The order of this memory vs [[Plushie Go Go]] is unclear. In this memory, MC is surprised to hear about [[Xavier]]'s claw machine guide, which is mentioned in [[Plushie Go Go]], implying that this memory is first. However, since he's actually able to get all the plushies, it would have to be after [[Plushie Go Go]] where he struggles for three hours and then asks MC to teach him.
	* ((This appears to be a straightforward and relatively inconsequential continuity error.))

# Trivia
* MC decided to go see a horror movie at midnight, but was surprised that the theater was empty.
	* This was one of the bucket list items.
* Xavier tries to scare MC a bit, like he also did in [[01-03 Talented Hunter]].
* [[Linkon Tower]] is one of the best sight-seeing spots in the city.

# Quotes

> Xavier: What if you thought about it seriously? What kind of guy would you like?
> *I begin to ponder.*
> Me: Well, let's set some standards. First... He has to be at least 180 centimeters tall.
> Xavier: And?
> Me: He... should have a nice face, sharp features, and eyes that draw you in like the starry sky. As for his personality, he has to be sweet, funny, cool, and cute. And I would love for him to be an awesome chef who can prepare a delicious meal for me!
> *Seeing how enthusiastic I am, Xavier can only shake his head, exasperated.*
> Xavier: Looks like your standards have become more unrealistic as you've grown older.

> Xavier: I've seen a lot of sunrises alone. So I might like someone who invites me to watch the sunrise with them.

> Xavier:Getting plushies is a lot easier than having a chiseled face and eyes as pretty as the starry sky.
