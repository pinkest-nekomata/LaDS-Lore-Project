**Description**
> On my day off, I see the novel that I've been trying to find at an old bookstore. I was about to ask about the price when I realized Xavier stood behind the counter...

# Summary
[[Xavier]] and MC run into each other at a bookstore that Xavier's watching for a friend. Xavier sells a group of dating books to a customer. MC decides to wait until the owner returns so she can buy the book she wants. She starts reading the book ([[After Sunset]]), and tells Xavier about it. They discuss having a reason to carry on even through hardships.

Xavier and MC aren't yet dating in this memory.

# Key Info
* The book MC wanted is *[[After Sunset]]*, a science fiction novel. She read the first half at her high school library during lunch breaks, but never got to finish it because it was borrowed by someone else.

# Trivia

	* It's sometimes closed for weeks at a time.
	* He's been running the store for a decade, and is now an elderly man.
	* He's surprised that Xavier is awake when he returns.
* Books with sudden bad endings put Xavier in a bad mood.

# Quotes

> Xavier: Perhaps the longer the night, the more visible the stars. And before then, there will also be a beautiful sunset.

> Xavier: Since you've been looking for this book, you must really like the bird's story.
> MC: Yeah. During my high school years, I was feeling a bit lost. This book touched a part of my heart, in a way. To see the sunrise, this bird can endure so much... I aspire to be like that
> Xavier: Like what?
> MC: l guess... I want the unwavering determination to keep pushing forward. No matter what it takes.
> Xavier:It doesn't take that much determination to keep going. Sometimes it's actually harder to let go.

> Xavier: You said you aspire to have that kind of determination. Then maybe you should first look for... the goal that you're willing to weather the storm for.
> MC: What about you? Do you have a goal like that?
> Xavier: ...

> Xavier: You can just walk upstairs to knock on my door. I'll be looking forward to the story you'll bring me.
