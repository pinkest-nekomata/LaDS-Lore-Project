Common shorthand for [[Metaflux]] fluctuations. Also sometimes referred to as "energy fluctuations".

Fluctuations allow [[Wanderer]]s to appear. The strength of the fluctuation determines the likelihood that [[Wanderer]]s will appear, but it's not a guarantee ([[03-A Thorns Under the Moon - 03]]). Some [[Wanderer]]s are able to appear without causing normal fluctuations, such as [[Luminivore]]s ([[01-01.04 Heart Towards Resonance]]).

MC's [[Resonance Evol]] is also able to detect these fluctuations, and is more sensitive than the [[Hunter's Watch]] ([[01-01.02 Mysterious Light]]).

[[Flux Stablizer]]s are designed to neutralize [[Metaflux]] fluctuations and prevent [[Wanderer]]s from appearing.

[[Protocore]]s, and especially [[Aether Core]]s, also produce [[fluctuation]]s. These can be minor and simply used to analyze/identify the core, or may be large enough to attract [[Wanderer]]s.
