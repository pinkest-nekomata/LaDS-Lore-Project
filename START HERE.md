Welcome! If you have any general questions about the project, please refer to [[README]].

**It is highly recommended to watch this content in-game first. THERE ARE MANY UNTAGGED SPOILERS HERE, INCLUDING MYTH AND MEMORY SPOILERS.**

I'll keep updating this guide as I add new content, especially overviews and summaries.

For now, the most useful starting place is the [[00 Main Story]] index and the [[Main Story Timeline]], which help put the game's (many) events into perspective.
