# Summary
At the sanctuary, [[Sorceress MC]] and [[Sylus]] see the mural that supposedly depicts the Fiend's imprisonment. They destroy the Sanctuary, but the [[Legion of Justitia]] is no match for the dragon, and MC is unable to escape.

The dragon brings her back to his lair, and she flees the first chance she gets--only to find that the sheer cliffs that surround the lair keep her trapped. Following him, he leads her to his horde, which is overflowing with riches and the weapons left by those who came to kill him and failed. He tells her to take whatever she wants, encouraging her greed. Only once she embraces her desires will she be worthy to be the Fiend's meal.

# Details

> Over 1600 years ago, after centuries of war with humanity, the dragon, said in legend to bring about Philos's end, was finally sealed in the Abyss beneath the fiend-infested [[Tarus]] City by the [[Legion of Justitia]].
> The decisive event, known as the "Battle of Tarus", led to widespread praise for the Legion. the leader who drove his sword into the dragon's heart was revered as the "[[Sacred Judicator]]".
> Monuments honoring his deeds stand tall across Philos, and his followers built a grand [[Sanctuary]] in his name after his death.
> Every year, the [[Sanctuary]] takes in some of the city's orphans in the name of the [[Sacred Judicator]]. It is a place held in even higher regard than the royal palace.
> When these orphans come of age, a [[Judicator's Oracle]], dressed in magnificent robes, takes them away to join the [[Legion of Justitia]].
> However... the [[Judicator's Oracle]] who came to take me threw me into the [[Abyss]] in front of everyone.

The background changes to the [[Sanctuary]] with its white marble and statues. The design is very church-like, and the contrast is clear between the [[black chapel]] and this place.

> *The pure white Sactuary stands in solemn grandeur, and the pristine marble floor gleams. The intricate wall carvings are maintained, appearing new. They looked just like this when I was taken away. The followers gathered here scatter the moment they see the "sorceress" who was supposed to be dead. As for the guards, they fall apart like dominoes with just a flick of a finger.*
> Dragon: Growing up in a cage like this... No wonder your soul is so dull. It's time.
> MC: (Revenge is important, but so is staying alive... The news of the Fiend's appearance in the Sanctuary must be spreading like wildfire in the city. Once the [[Legion of Justitia]] arrives to deal with him... I can slip away in the chaos.)
> *I watch the last guard disappear from view, pretending I didn't see them as I turn away.*
> MC: The [[Judicator's Oracle]] who judged me isn't here, so my revenge will have to wait--for now, at least. Otherwise--
> *However, the dragon shows no interest in my plan for revenge. He stands in a beam of sunlight deep within the Sanctuary. His figure stands out against the pure white architecture. Yet he's like a statue that belongs here. Taken aback, I quickly shake my head and move to his side.*
> Dragon: `(Bitterly)` What is that?
> *Following the dragon's gaze, I see the mural on the Sanctuary's ceiling. At its center is a god-like figure in a bright red cloak, wielding a long sword as he executes an evil dragon in a corner.*
> MC: Oh... *The Fiend-Slaying God.* The god-like man represents the [[Sacred Judicator]], and that evil dragon getting a sword through its chest in the corner... Ahem, that's probably you.
> *I can't figure out why he keeps staring at it--Forget the insult; the dragon is drawn without any semblance of beauty.*
> Dragon: ... `(Sighs/scoffs)`
> *The dragon lowers his eyes, casting a calm, scrutinizing glance over my face.*
> MC: ...Of course, it's just the artist's take. You're much more handsome and imposing in real life.
> *He looks at the text beneath the mural.*
> Dragon: It's been 1,677 years since I was sealed away.
> MC: You can read that?
> Dragon: You can't?
> MC: It's written in an ancient language that's been lost to time. Nobody can read it anymore. What does it say?
> *The fiend looks at the ceiling again.*
> Dragon: The Fiend is the very essence of malice and greed, skilled at twisting human desires. He drives mortals to turn against each other, leading them to their own demise. Given time, the world will be swallowed by chaos and descend into ruination. The Fiend's arrival marks the onset of Doomsday. During the Battle of Tarus, the [[Sacred Judicator]], with a will of iron, stood firm against the corruption of evil. In a war so fierce, he emerged as the sole, honorable survivor. He sealed away the fiend, the very harbinger of Doomsday, deep within the planet's chasm. With the curse of Doomsday lifted, hope was restored to Philos.
> MC: I heard the Fiend--which is you--has a destined archnemesis. This individual must be the [[Sacred Judicator]], correct?
> Dragon: `Scoffs.` What a lofty title.
> MC: Yeah, this story sounds pretty fake to me too.
> *Sunlight spills through the Sanctuary's entrance. The silence is so intense that it's unsettling.*
> MC: (The [[Legion of Justitia]] still haven't arrived... If there's no one to hold him back, I can't escape...)
> *I try to think of other ways to stall, so I quickly shift the conversation.*
> MC: Ah, yes. This is the resting place of your archnemesis. The [[Sacred Judicator]] in the mural might be long dead, but his ashes are kept here. There's even a statue of him in the inner hall.
> *I sit on the armrest of a bench. Feigning excitement, I rest my chin in my hand and look at the fiend.*
> MC: So, what's your pick for revenge? Smash it to bits, douse it in ink, cover it with curses, or scatter his ashes onto the streets?
> *He falls silent again. I look over and see his countenance veiled in a soft light. It's difficult to discern the emotions hidden underneath.*
> MC: This man trapped you in the Abyss for over a thousand years while he was worshipped s a hero, basking in glory--
> Dragon: `(Scoffs.)` Are you referring to that glory built upon ignorant faith? Do you expect me to envy such foolishness?
> MC: But...
> `The screen goes white.`
> *Swoosh! A Justitia arrow, forged form golden ore and crackling with electricity, cuts through the air right as I speak.*
> MC: (Finally!)
> *Next to me, the Fiend raises his hand and makes a pinching motion. The flying arrow immediately disintegrates into particles.*
> Dragon: How boring.
> *Right before the next attack, the Sanctuary is engulfed in a dazzling light that blinds everyone present with its radiance.*
> Dragon: `Ngh!`
> MC: (Now...!)
> *Behind the silver light, blades charge straight for the Fiend. They're accompanied by the sound of hurried footsteps. I step back and look for an opportunity to run outside--*
> Dragon: `Heh.` How impudent.
> *I hear the crisp snap of his fingers behind me. A sharp pain suddenly surges from deep within my chest as if my soul has been taken. I can't move. My limbs stiffen and move uncontrollably, forcing me to turn around. I gasp as I take in the sight before me.
> The guards are tearing into each other like marionetes on invisible strings--slashing, ripping, and killing without mercy.
> Blood spatters across the engraved wals. The candelabras are toppled amidst the chaos, setting the drapes ablaze. The stained glass windows, once vibrant, now cast an ominous red glow, reflecting a twisted vision of purgatory.
> Haunting wails and screams, echo through the Sanctuary. The Fiend watches as the place descends into a blood-soaked inferno. He scoffs.*
> Dragon: Even after all these years, mortals are still foolish to the last.
> *As light streams in through the stained glass, I can see the Fiend's blood-spattered face and the cold, cruel curve of his lips.*
> Dragon: Come.
> `He beckons with a hand. MC lurches forward.`
> MC: (His eye... It's his eye manipulating everything...!)
> Dragon: You're only somewhat clever. But it's still a pitiful display. If you're planning to kill with a borrowed knife, you'd better make sure the blade is sharp enough.
* ((That is: If you're going to try to get the [[Legion of Justitia]] to kill me, you'd better make sure they're actually capable of doing so.))
> *The familiar excruciating pain tears through my flesh once more. And the faint [[golden light ]]mixed with black mist is once again pulled from my body.*
> MC: (His eye... It should be mine...)
> Dragon: Even on the brink of death, you still dare to covet my eye. You greedy fool. What a shame.
> MC: Wait! You can kill me whenever you like. But if you spare me, I can help you achieve more! And--
> *I bite my lip hard, forcing myself to stay calm and steady as I speak to him.*
> MC: I want to live and I want your eye. It's like how you want my soul. Is there a problem with that? It's just too bad that I'm not as strong as you.
> Dragon: Hmm. `He shakes his head.`
> *The grip around my neck suddenly loosens.*
> Dragon: You said you could help me achieve more. Give me an example.
> *I take two steps back. I cover my neck as I steady myself. My mind races, scrambling for anything a dragon might want.*
> MC: I... can help you amass a large amount of wealth and collect a lot of souls--whatever you need, I can get it for you.
> *In the next moment, my body is lifted off the ground as he soars into the sky.*
> MC: What are you doing now?!
> Dragon: Ask again, and I'll devour you whole.
> *With a snap of his fingers, energy erupts from the flames. The columns of fire rise upward and stain the clouds in mesmerizing crimson hues.
> The ground shakes, and the magnificent, solemn Sanctuary at the heart of the city quickly crumbles into ruins.*
> Dragon: For something as tedious as revenge, this will suffice. No need for a spectacle.
> *The wind sweeps up the screams and shouts of terror. The Fiend holds me and flaps his wings as he flies off into the blazing sunset.*

The background shifts to a rocky cave.
> *Before the sun disappears under the horizon, we chase the last fragment of light. We find ourselves in a lair perched atop a cliff. As I look down in midair, the cliff and lair form a breathtaking sight between the peaks, like the skeleton of a dragon poised to take flight. He lands on the other side where the lighting is noticeably better. And there are no blood-soaked stone platforms.*
> MC: ... Is this your home?
> Dragon: Have you ever met a fiend with a home?
> *After the dragon puts me down--although it feels more like I was dropped--he drags his tail along a stone staircase to the upper level of the cave. Seeing that he isn't trying to restrain me, I turn and run toward the cave's entrance.*
> `The background shows a cliff's edge, and beyond it, the red and shadowy silhouete of Tarus City.`
> *Pebbles roll off the cliff, but I can't hear them fall. I stop just in time to stare at the sheer cliffside outside. My heart sinks into the depths of despair.*
> MC: (...Fine. If I can't go back to the Ivory City, I guess this dragon's lair will have to do.)
> *Light illuminates the cave every so often. I follow the faint glow up the stone steps and catch up to the figure ahead of me.*
> MC: I suppose... You won't be eating my soul for now?
> Dragon: `(Scoffs.)` Assuming that was still the case, why would I even bring you back here? Stay put.
* ((Recall that in Chapter 1, Sylus said, "Then I shall promise to give you a painless death. Unless... you wish to become a minion of a dragon's nest."))

> *Of course I don't believe this dragon spared me just because I can help him make money. But I don't know what he has planned for me. I walk up to him and continue our conversation.*
> MC: If I'm going to live here, my living quarters should at least be decent. Your cave is too... basic. What do you think?
> *Following the spiral stone staircase to the top of the cave, I feel as if i stepped into a world that never sees the light.
> The dragon stops walking. His tail coils around my waist and lifts me to the final step. With a cold, lowered gaze, he stares at me.*
> Dragon: Choose.
> *Unspoken words catch in my throat as I watch him snap his fingers. He releases an energy orb that floats into the cave's depths. One by one, red flames ignite as far as the eye can see. My surroundings are illuminated by their shimmering light. Before me is... an endless array of treasures and luxurious garments.*
> Dragon: t
> MC: ...You'd really give these to me?
> Dragon: Why not? You're also mine now.
> *His tail wraps around me again. My body is turned around and pushed toward the treasure trove. The dragon's lair hasn't been visited for a long time. I make my way to a pile of gold, clear away thick cobwebs, and spot an old, toppled sword rack behind it.
> I lift the nearly rotted wood and pick up a dagger that glints with a cold, sharp light.*
> Dragon: It's called the [[Fiendbane]]. Legends say you could plunge it into a dragon's heart and twist it three times to completely shatter the dragon's soul.
> MC: ...
> *I set the dagger down and notice an open box to my right. Inside is a blade that looks like a hidden weapon.*
> Dragon: The [[Golden Crow's Feather of Eternity.]] Designed specifically for gouging out a dragon's eyes. You humans seem to think the longer the name, the more formidable the weapon. But this little thing isn't even good for trimming my nails.
* ((The Golden Crow is also known as the [Three-Legged Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-legged_crow) in CN mythology.))
> *I turn and look around the vast treasure trove.*
> MC: I never expected your collection would be all weapons. Do dragons have hobbies to?
> Dragon: Your kind brought them here willingly.
> MC: I imagine they weren't... particularly polite about it.
> Dragon: Indeed. It's a shame those who brought them to me are all dead, and I'm still alive.
> MC: So, the sword that sealed you away... Was it really "given" to you by the [[Sacred Judicator]] in the mural?
> Dragon: `(Scoffs)` He was just lucky to get his hands on it and fortunate enough to drive it into my chest. But only its true master can wield its power.
> MC: (And that sword is inside me now... Does that mean I'm its "true master"?)
> *I clench my fist, but maybe my timing is off. The phantom of the greatsword doesn't appear as I'd hoped. Rounding a thick stone pillar, I find myself staring, not at weapons, but at a seemingly endless horde of treasures--fine clothes, paintings, musical instruments.
> Shocked, I can only stare until I realize I've just swallowed my saliva.*
> Dragon: If you want something, just reach out and take it.
> *In the flickering firelight, our shadows intertwine on the dimly lit wall.*
> Dragon: `(Leaning closer)` Just. Like. This. Let your greed and desire burn a little brighter...
> *His tail glides up my calf. Smiling, the Fiend leans in to whisper into my ear.*
> Dragon: This is how you'll become worthy enough to be my meal.
> *Holding a gem, my hand clenches in fear. I turn my head as his tail suddenly tightens around me. He laughs watching me struggle in his grasp.*
> MC: ...No wonder you spared me. You want to fatten me up before going in for the kill.
> Dragon: Even so, you still cling to that gem despite being so close to Death's sweet embrace. You truly are a source of entertainment.
> MC: Enjoy my company while you can. I might bring you a deadlier experience next time.
> Dragon: Who says death can't be entertaining in itself?
> *The firelight casts shadows under his eyelashes. He leans in. He's so close that I can feel his breath enveloping me. It's reminiscent of liquor's intoxicating aroma.*
> Dragon: I'll be waiting with bated breath.
