**Description**
> On a rainy day off, I saw a Pile It Up commercial on TV. It reminded me of when things were just getting better between Sylus and me...

# Key Info
* This memory takes place after [[Razor's Grip]], which is the memory that first introduces [[Sylus's private jet]].
* MC finds Sylus in [[Goldwood City]] because her flight got cancelled and none of the hotels were available.
* Sylus keeps his many satellite locations as bare as possible (no clothes in the closet, no plates or cups in the cupboard) to avoid leaving evidence behind. It doesn't look like anyone lives there, even though he spent a month or two there before.
* Sylus buys MC [[Pile It Up]] after seeing that she was bored.
* MC hides Pile It Up blocks around the apartment (drawer, wall cabinet, etc) to leave her mark.

# Trivia
* There's a wheelchair in Sylus's [[Goldwood City]] apartment. He says an acquaintance, a "meticulous old gentleman" gave it to him in case he was injured.
* Sylus's [[Goldwood City]] apartment has a chess board and now a game of [[Pile It Up]].

> MC: ...Sylus, your words say one thing but your actions say another. It's obvious you don't want me to go.

> *He laughs heartily, moving even closer to me.*
> Sylus: But this is how you should be. If you're going to mark territory, aim higher. Claim me and my territory. From now on, how you lave your mark in any place... It's your call.
