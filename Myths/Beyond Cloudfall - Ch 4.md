# Summary
MC and Sylus go on a shopping trip into [[Tarus]], finding it to be a pretty mundane market except for all the fiend-themed things. A blind merchant shares a prediction that the Fiend and his destined archnemesis will meet in the [[black chapel]]. (They already have.)

New trinkets in hand, they return to the lair.

## Commentary

# Details
> Tarus City sits near the foot of the dragon's lair. The origin of its name is lost to time, but it's said to be connected to the Abyss.
* ((It's are reference to [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus), "the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans." The space-time prison and Sylus's Tomorrow's Catch 22 AU also reference Tartarus.))

MC and Sylus walk through Tarus's market, which offers odd wares like [[Wanderer]] heads and thighs. She's looking for a pipe organ, but ends up dragging him to various shops. They banter.

> *"I'll take what's most valuable in this world"--that's the deal he silently agreed to. But right now, I just want to see an invincible fiend looking troubled.*
> MC: You have no intention of disguising yourself?
> Sylus: No need. No one would believe a fiend would wander around a market. Besides, everyone sees a fiend differently--some see ugliness, others see horror, cruelty... What they see isn't me. They only see their own hearts.
> *I hold up a mirror from a stall. It reflects the face of the dragon.*
> MC: Can you guess what I see when I look at you?
> *He lowers the mirror as if he heard a childish joke. He leans closer.*
> Sylus: At the very least, I'm a lot more handsome than I was depicted in that *Fiend-Slaying God* mural.

MC comments that the market is much more normal than she expected.
> Sylus: You won't be able to find wind chimes made of finger bones anywhere else.

MC examines a goat bone amulet, commenting that in the Sanctuary they believe horns represent fiends. ((Compare to the real-world "[horned god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_God)" and the [inverted pentacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_of_Baphomet) that is said to resemble a goat's face with horns, and therefore represent Baphomet, Satan, earthly desires, and carnality.))

She keeps shopping, looking for something small to bring home. She teases him, admiring a volcanic stone pendant in the shape of a crippled dragon, and a fiend's eye bracelet, saying it's cuter than what's in his horde.
> MC: I can't believe I almost forgot how sharp your tongue is after we spent so much time together. Getting a nice word out of you is like pulling teeth.

Referring back to their deal, she asks him to tell her about the most valuable piece in his collection. He notes the "painted oil lamp made of pure gold" (which he was looking at when she tried to kill him) and "that ruby necklace".
> Dragon: You wouldn't use them even if I gave them to you. Why are you interested in cheap things?
> MC: You actually measure worth based on monetary value?
> Dragon: `(Scoffs)` There's another way?
> *I sigh dramatically and click my tongue, trying to appear deep and wise.*
> MC: You certainly live up to the stereotype of dragons being greedy for treasure... However, true value comes from something a little warmer. Take this bracelet for instance. It might not look impressive, but it carries a great significance.
> *Ignoring his dark, brooding look, I grab the dragon's hand and, without waiting for permission, slip the bracelet onto his wrist.*
> MC: Here. Look at the words engraved on it.
> Sylus: `(Skeptical)` "The Fiend shall always shield you"? How warm and comforting.
> *The dragon glances down at the bracelet but doesn't take it off right away. The pupilless merchant senses something and quickly faces us. He taps his tobacco pipe with pinpoint accuracy on the bracelet.*
> Merchant: One piece of information or thirty gold coins for the bracelet.
> MC: For this bone bracelet? At best it's worth--
> *I'm about to start haggling, but when I look up, the dragon is already opening his pouch. A cascade of gold coins spills from his hand onto the counter. The blind merchant doesn't move to count them. His ears just twitch slightly.*
> Merchant: You've given too much. Rules are rules--I'll keep the gold and give you two pieces of information. First--the Fiend has returned. The [[Legion of Justitia]] will march to [[Tarus]] City soon. You two need to be careful.
> *Sylus and I exchange a glance. The merchant, expressionless, turns his face toward me.*
> Merchant: As for the second one... Before long, the Fiend will meet his destined archnemesis once again. Right over there.
> *He tilts his pipe, and my eyes folow. In the distance, beyond the barren forest, I spot an obsidian spire jutting out.*
> *I hook my arm around the dragon's neck, stand on my tiptoes, and whisper in his ear.*
> MC: Isn't that the place where you tried to eat me for the first time?
* ((ie the [[black chapel]], the first place that Sylus took MC after she freed him.))
> Sylus: Do you wish to return for the sake of nostalgia?
> MC: I don't see why not. Who knows? Maybe something unexpected will occur there.
> Sylus: An abandoned, dilapidated chapel won't offer anything work the trek. Don't forget why I'm here with you.
> *I let go of the dragon's neck and pretend to be displeased.*
> MC: It's not like you just found out I'm insatiable. If I can't get the organ, I'll just grab a few other things as consolation. These, these, and these... Don't they all suit you perfectly?
> *I quickly pick up a few intricately designed and shove them into the dragon's arms. Then, I stand on my tiptoes to hang a bone wind chime on his horn.*
> Sylus: `(Grumbling)` You--
> MC: What?
> *Our gazes meet. I blink at him as I'm still standing on my tiptoes. The evening sky casts a soft, rosy glow over the dragon. He looks at me for a moment, then sets the coin pouch on the table.*
> Sylus: ...Since you want all of them, don't leave a single one behind. Take everything. We're leaving.
> *I open my arms to the dragon and he lifts me. He carries me and my treasures as we soar over Tarus City.*
