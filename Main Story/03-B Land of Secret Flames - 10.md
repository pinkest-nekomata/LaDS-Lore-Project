# Summary
With the [[Wanderer]] defeated, [[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] can head deeper on their treasure hunt. [[Rafayel]] summons a small [[Flammula]] to guide them, and they travel to a large stone slab bearing the [[Tome of the Sea God]]. Rafayel says only someone with a bond to the [[Sea God]] ((i.e. [[the pact]])) can open the tome, and he takes a droplet of [[MC]]'s blood to do so.

This causes [[golden light]] to surround them, and MC has a flashback to her childhood encounter and [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]]. When she returns to her senses, Rafayel is unconscious, so she hurries with him toward the surface.

## Commentary
There are many important lore elements here. Unlike Xavier's and Zayne's branches, [[MC]] doesn't flash back to memories from her myth, but to her childhood encounter with [[Rafayel]]. Still, there are many references to both [[Forgotten Sea]] and [[Sea of Golden Sand]]. This location features prominently in both, being home to the [[Tome of the Sea God]], and [[Rafayel]] indirectly references the [[Lemurian disaster]]. Now, he reclaims [[Lemuria]]'s forgotten power.

#todo connect this to the myth analysis

### Portal to another world
One of the legends that [[Rafayel]] mentions is that the [[blue hole]] can be considered a portal. This could be a hint that the [[Tome of the Sea God]] might not literally be at the base of that hole so much as it's able to act as a portal and allow access to the Tome.

### Heart of the sea
#todo, add details from [[Forgotten Sea]] about how [[MC]] ends up with the [[Sea God]]'s heart due to [[the pact]].

# Description
After they defeat the [[Wanderer]], the [[Protofield]] disappears and MC finds herself under the water. She starts to swim for the surface, but then hears [[Rafayel]] tell her to stop and turn her head. She hears his voice normally, then he gives her a gentle kiss, and she's able to breathe normally underwater too.

He teases her about seeing if her tears turn to pearls, then touches the area around her eyes before conjuring a tiny [[Flammula]]. He says it's time to find his treasure. The fish rubs him affectionately, then guides them into the depths.

> MC: Is there really a hidden [[Lemurian]] treasure at the bottom?
> Rafayel: Only the undercurrent beneath the high tide and the tiniest fish know its location.

MC teases the little fish and it's affectionate towards her, and she remarks that it doesn't have good survival instincts. Rafayel clarifies that it's only comfortable around her because she has a familiar scent.
* ((This is one of our first clear nods to [[Forgotten Sea]]))

As they proceed into the dark, [[Rafayel]] summons a flame to light the way. He says they're close to the entrance. After feeling a mysterious force, [[MC]] guesses that the [[Aether Core]] fragment might also be in the same destination. She asks where they're going.

> Rafayel: After we follow the surging tide and pass through a crevice, we'll reach a hidden fjord.

He warns her that the undercurrent in the crevice will be chaotic, and to hold on tightly. They emerge in the deeper sea, and a light pulses gently ahead.
> Rafayel: This is the island's cornerstone. It once bore the weight of [[Lemuria]]'s past and future.
* ((Notably, the [[Forgotten Sea]] and [[Sea of Golden Sand]] myths also describe Lemuria's past and future, and this island is a key location in both.))

Rafayel says they've now found part of [[Lemuria]]'s long-lost [[Tome of the Sea God]]. Red seaweed waves like fire.
> We stand on a massive, thick stone slab. The engravings on its surface are the light source.
> MC: Those glowing marks look like symbols. Legend has it that the [[Tome of the Sea God]] contains prophecies about [[Lemuria]]'s future...
> Rafayel: But this part speaks of oblivion, not the future. 
> MC: Are you referring to how the world forgot about [[Lemuria]]'s history?
> Rafayel: It's not just that, there's also power. Those who borrowed power from the sea betrayed it in the end. They mistook the sea's tolerance for submission and forgot about its cruelty. But I remember. And will reclaim this forgotten power.
> MC: ...Looks like that's where I come in, huh? What do you need me to do?
> *Rafayel takes my hand as he materializes a dagger.*
> Rafayel: Only those who have a bond with the [[Sea God]] can awaken the Tome. I need you to bear with me for a moment.
> *The dagger grazes my fingertip. A drop of my blood is quickly sealed in a tiny bubble that falls onto the vibrant red seaweed. The distant roar of a Tsunami echoes in my mind, accompanied by immense glowing symbols swirling and materializing. They pierce my body and ascend.*
> `Golden light is seen flowing on the screen.`
> *Fragmented images that are bathed in a golden glow and a child-like voice break through the haze. They flood my mind--*
> ??? ((Rafayel)): You... awakened me...
> MC: (Whose memory... is this...?)
> ??? ((Rafayel)): ...Hey, are you listening? ...I'm not stranded. It's the waves... they're just too strong. Where I come from... if you say you like someone's scales, that means you like them... You humans are bold. We've only known each other for a day, and already you're thinking about our next meeting. Remember... We'll see each other again at this spot next year. This bond means you'll definitely come back to me. I'll always wait for you...
> MC: Then... I, too...
> *The waves sweep away these fragmented memories. A cold breeze tinged with the scent of seaweed caresses my face, and I struggle to open my eyes...*
> MC: Rafayel...
> *Golden symbols pulsate with immense power. They surge into [[Rafayel]]'s body. With his eyes tightly shut and his face pale, he collapses into my arms.*
> MC: Rafayel!
> *The Flammula swims past me, its tail leaving behind a trail of bubbles. My gaze follows it to the crevice found on the fjord's cliff. As a shield of [[golden light]] blocks the turbulent seawater around us, I tightly hold onto Rafayel and swim toward the crevice*
