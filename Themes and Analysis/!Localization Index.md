This topic collects all analysis and commentary on localization of the game. Generally, these will be topics where something is lost in translation.

# Key topics

## Celestial Bodies
* [[celestial bodies in CN]] - the CN words for "planet" and "star" are the same, and the same celestial body isn't always translated the same way
	* [[Feathers Planet]] is called "Feathers Star" in-game, but is a planet
	* [[Philos]] and alpha-P0159 are one and the same, and it's a planet. Spacepedia incorrectly calls it the "core of a star"

## You!
In EN, the "you" pronoun is used relatively sparingly, and calling someone simply "you" often comes off rude/aggressive. (e.g. "Hey, you!") However, CN, JP, and KN use the pronoun in a more familiar way. Someone might say "you" instead of the person's name in an affectionate context, for example. This is very helpful for visual novels where the player name is dynamic.

The EN localization mostly addresses this by using nicknames in place of the pronoun or player's name where appropriate. However, you may still see a few uses of "You..." or "You!" that might feel slightly awkward or intense in EN, and this is the reason.

## Odd dialogue pacing in cutscenes
Keen listeners will notice in cutscenes (i.e. the "movie" style scenes vs the "visual novel" style ones) that sometimes either the voice actors in EN will speak a bit faster than usual, or that there's occasionally "glitchy"-sounding audio artifacts resulting from audio files being sped up. (This has even lead some people to speculate the voices are AI, but it's actually an artifact of them being human recordings.)

This is a common challenge with dubs where sometimes EN takes more words to communicate the same idea. Localizers will generally try to make the EN succinct enough to account for this, but it's not always possible. So, the words need to be said a bit unnaturally fast to fit them all in. With talented VAs, you might not even notice it until you look for it. The digitally sped-up lines seem to be due to the voice directors not knowing how much time the line would have available at the time of recording, and so having to fix it afterwards.

On the flip side, sometimes the localization needs to add some "filler" content to ensure there aren't awkward pauses.  But this is usually less of an issue, especially since the game uses lip motion capture for each localization individually, which is why the lip movements always line up perfectly in every language. (And why you sometimes see some odd lip movements when the LIs are sighing, since the lip mo-cap is trying to match to syllables.)

The separate lip mo-cap per localization is actually a really cool achievement, since in anime and even most video games, dub VAs not only have to match the overall pacing, but try to map the individual lip flaps as well.

# Misc
* [[Luke and Kieran#Name localization]] clarifies that the twins' names are meant to directly invoke "light and shadow", but it's a bit of a stretch in EN
