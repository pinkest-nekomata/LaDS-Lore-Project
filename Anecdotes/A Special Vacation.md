Seven year old [[Frank]] experiences a week in the life of a [[Deepspace Hunter]]

## Summary

This is a cute slice of life story from the perspective of [[Frank]], the seven-year-old son of [[Xavier]]'s friend [[Ulysses]]. [[Frank]] has to write a paper about what he wants to be when he grows up--and it's a [[Deepspace Hunter]]. So, he spends a week with Xavier.

We get a window into Xavier's usual routine. He spends the night fighting [[Wanderer]]s (which he hides from [[Frank]]) and the day sleeping and eating hot pot. We see how [[Xavier]] plays dumb to keep the attention off himself, but when [[Wanderer]]s attack during the day, he's not able to hide his skills from [[Frank]].

## Commentary
Nothing *too* consequential here, but it's a nice peek into [[Xavier]]'s day-to-day life before the main story.

# 01 Frank's Summer Homework
[[Ulysses]]'s seven year old son, [[Frank]], is given an assignment to write about what he wants to be when he grows up. He wants to be a [[Deepspace Hunter]], of course! Ulysses smiles, saying he has a friend who's a [[Deepspace Hunter]] and the "best of the best". (This is [[Xavier]].)

Frank is a bit miffed to meet [[Xavier]] looking sleepy in pajamas. He's not like the hunters in comic books. Upon seeing his silver hair, he wonders if he should address Xavier as "grandpa", but given his young face maybe "uncle"?
* ((This is a cute note because Xavier is waaaay more than old enough to be "grandpa", but he does look young.))
* If you're not already familiar, in CN it's commonly respectful to refer to people older than you as "uncle"/"auntie" and elders as "grandpa"/"grandma" regardless of how well you know them. EN doesn't really have an equivalent. ([ChineseEdge.com](https://chineseedge.com/how-to-address-people-in-chinese-names-titles-and-honorifics/))

# 02 A Deepspace Hunter's Home
[[Frank]] will stay with [[Xavier]] for a little while (hence the anecdote title, "A Special Vacation"). Frank asks where his armory is--Xavier says he doesn't have enough weapons for one. And so on, as Frank is disappointed Xavier isn't like the cartoons.

Xavier's terrible cooking extends to his juice making skills. [[Frank]] forces himself to drink the disgusting liquid to be polite, thinking it's an energy supplement or something--and then is miffed to find out [[Xavier]] intended for it to just be juice.

((Notably, [[Xavier]]'s terrible cooking skills are themselves a nod to him being from [[Philo]] and still not quite having a taste for Earth food.))

# 03 A Hunter's Free Time
[[Frank]] muses about how he expects [[Xavier]] to go out and fight [[Wanderer]]s all day. Actually, he stumbles across evidence [[Xavier]] has fought them all night--he's asleep on the couch, still dressed, with [[Metaflux]] on his clothes. Frank doesn't know enough to put this together, though.

Frank also takes a nap, and when he wakes up, [[Xavier]] is about to leave. [[Frank]] runs over to him, and joins him outside. He's surprised at how late in the day [[Xavier]] is getting his start. But instead of fighting [[Wanderer]]s, they just go to get hot pot. They they go to the supermarket, then a book store... and return home. Miffed, Frank guesses that maybe it's Xavier's "weekend".

# 04 A Hunter's Secret Training
A week passes and [[Frank]] still doesn't see any [[Wanderer]] action. Though, he does catch [[Xavier]] on the balcony, covered in [[Metaflux]] again.
> "Why didn't you bring me with you if you're fighting Wanderers?"
> [[Xavier]] pushes [[Frank]] to his room as he walks. "Go to bed. If you're not tall enough, you're not allowed to fight Wanderers."
> "Okay..."

The next morning, [[Xavier]] finally realizes (or is reminded) that [[Frank]] is here to write an essay. He gives [[Frank]] some more direct (but still cagey) answers. [[Xavier]] lets frank believe that the other hunters are faster than him and able to take care of all the [[Wanderer]]s before [[Xavier]] ever knows about them. ((Ironically, it's more the other way around.))

When [[Xavier]] mentions training being part of his schedule when he's not fighting [[Wanderer]]s, [[Frank]] begs to train with him.

# 05 The Real Battle
It's a sunny day at [[Linkon Central Park]]. [[Xavier]] offers [[Frank]] his choice of weapons, and he picks a wooden sword. Xavier gets a stick, telling Frank to knock it out of his hand. After ten minutes, he still can't. So, he switches to a water gun. Xavier gets a paper cup. Ten minutes later, Xavier is dry and the paper cup is full of water. So then Frank gets maracas. Xavier breaks his stick in half so he has two pieces. Another ten minutes pass, and Frank still hasn't "beaten" Xavier, and he's exhausted, but he's finally happy that he's learning how to fight Wanderers. But when he asks if this is how [[Xavier]] trained and he says "no", [[Frank]] is disappointed again.

But [[Xavier]] is distracted. He tells [[Frank]] to wait, and he'll be back--then notices [[Frank]] is on the verge of tears. At that moment, there's an explosion and [[Xavier]] scoops him up and covers his eyes.

[[Wanderer]]s have appeared--the sky darkens, a police siren goes off. Xavier sets him down, summons a shield of light around him, then runs off. Frank sees him materialize his light sword, and it's *way* cooler than the weapons on TV. As people flee, [[Xavier]] heads in. He cuts down wanderer after wanderer with his light blade attacks, telling people to evacuate.

Frank is amazed.

# 06 A Kept Secret
[[Xavier]] gets [[Frank]] some ice cream, and [[Frank]] notices that [[Xavier]] isn't telling the police he's the one who took care of the [[Wanderer]]s. Frank expects him to get praised on TV, and gets the sense that [[Xavier]] doesn't want people knowing about what he does. But now that he's convinced that [[Xavier]] really is an amazing hunter, he trusts him.

[[Ulysses]] returns for [[Frank]], and reads his extremely enthusiastic essay. He asks what they did together, but Xavier says they just went for hot pot and such.

Ulysses muses:
> He doesn't know what kind of secret his son agreed to keep for [[Xavier]], but... 
> Whatever. It's not on Frank.
> After all, when Ulysses was younger, he was also "fooled" by Xavier.
