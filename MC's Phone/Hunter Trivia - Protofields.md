# Key Info
* [[Protofield]]s may be pocket dimensions or [[spacetime]] rifts
	* ((the spacetime rift hints at the Protofields being abl to depict [[Philos]], where many [[Wanderer]]s originated.))
* A "circular, mysterious symbol can be found in most Protofields". The [[Hunters Association]] doesn't have answers, but the concentric design resembles the [[diamond pattern]] on the [[Flux Nexus]]. Also, these locations are confirmed to be from [[Philos]] through various Myths.
