This sled dog replica was initially developed for swift traversal through snowy forests and mountains. Due to the influx of [[Arctic]] tourists, and in an effort to not upset the public's aesthetic sensibilities, the robot has been modified with realistic fur. It has gradually evolved into a multifunctional patrol dog complete with navigation capabilities. It's become a unique spectacle in the polar regions.
