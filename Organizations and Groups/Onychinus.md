# Meaning
*Onychinus* is greek for "Of the claw/talon"
* Onych = "claw" ([Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onych-))
	* Note that this is the same root as in Onyx
* -inus = of/pertaining to ([WordSense](https://www.wordsense.eu/-inus/))

Greek references are recurrent throughout Sylus's lore. "Tartarus" features in [[Tarus]] City, the name of the [[space-time prison]], and in the [[Tomorrow's Catch 22 AU]] as his [[Praedator]] name. And while [[Mephisto]]'s namesake Mephistopholes is from German folklore, the name itself is also derived from Greek. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephistopheles))
