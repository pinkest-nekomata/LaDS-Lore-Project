**Description**
> Behind a mechanical door of the [[Odd Workshop]], there's a massive [[Wanderer]] all souped up with Linkage Alterations. It seems that [[Sylus]] wants to give me a real "stimulation" with this one!

Companion: [[Sylus]]

[[Wanderer]](s)
* [[G-2BW]]

# Notes
Throughout this battle, the resonance ability is unavailable. The start of the battle plays these voice lines:

*Waiting for battle to begin*
Sylus: **“Are you scared? You should step back.”**
MC: **“Who said I was scared?”**
Sylus: **“What, do you want to see me fight alone?”**

*At start of battle*
**“Dammit, I can’t resonate."
**“It’s not too late to back out now.”**
