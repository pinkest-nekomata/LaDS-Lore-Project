# Backstory
*Detailed across several chapters in [[WU-14 Elysium]].*

**From [[WU-14 Elysium#02 Elysium]], when Aislinn was twelve (2025):**

Aislinn had an abusive father who beat her and threatened to kill her.
> Aislinn learned not to close her eyes when fists where flying.

One night when [[Aislinn]], he sent her to buy liquor. On her way, she sees [[Ginevra]] outside the bar where she works as a bouncer. [[Aislinn]] knows [[Ginevra]] is stronger than her father, so she gives [[Ginevra]] the blood-stained liquor money and demands to be taught how to fight to protect herself. [[Ginevra]] reluctantly agrees when she realizes Aislinn's injuries are from her abusive father (not a fight between kids).

Later, [[Ginevra]] says of the cash, "that tiny sum you had wouldn't even buy a single decent bullet."

**From [[WU-14 Elysium#03 Coward's Shell]], in the context of cowards in the [[N109 Zone]]:**

[[Ginevra]] adopts [[Aislinn]], and eleven years pass. Aislinn is now twenty three.

In 2036 (two years after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]) [[Ginevra]] moves to the [[N109 Zone]] and open a bar called [[Elysium]], and [[Aislinn]] decides to tag along. Not long after they settle in, Aislinn finds herself kicking out the third batch of thugs that tried to extort protection fees from them and complaining to [[Ginevra]].

At this time, [[Ginevra]] is working with [[Dexter]] on business Aislinn isn't privy to. Aislinn eavesdrops:
> It sounded like the scarred man wanted [[Ginevra]]'s help in finding someone this time. Aislinn caught a few telling phrases: "missing evolver", "test subject", "base of operations".

[[Ginevra]] regularly works with mysterious and rough characters, and vanishes after every "hush-hush talk". She says she's "restocking supplies" but returns injured every time.

As [[Dexter]] leaves, he warns Aislinn to watch her back. Their conversation implies that his cover's been blown and [[Ginevra]] is worried he might not make it back from this mission. (It indeed seems that he does not.) [[Dexter]] tells her if he dies, she should throw a few flowers on his grave.

Notably, of the mission, Dexter says, "we promised the parents that we'd bring their child home."

**From [[WU-14 Elysium#04 Strawberry Disaster Special]], still in 2036:**

Aislinn reflects on how she never saw [[Dexter]] again, and [[Ginevra]] brought silver windflowers back from somewhere. Given Dexter's comment, these are likely flowers for/from Dexter's grave.

Not long after, [[Ginevra]] goes missing for several months.

[[Aislinn]] keeps running [[Elysium]]. One night in late 2036, she hears customers talking about how "Special Task Force cops" ((which would include [[Ginevra]])) are looking for a [[Protocore map]], likely due to a related rumor that a priceless [[Protocore]] is hidden in the [[N109 Zone]].
* ((This is likely the other half of [[MC]]'s [[Aether Core]], which resurfaces in the the hands of [[Sherman]]'s branch of [[Onychinus]] at the [[Protocore auction]] in the main story.))

The customers discuss another rumor, that [[Sylus]] has been "eating people".

That night at midnight, Aislinn gets a chaotic call from [[Ginevra]]:
> On the other end, chaos reigned: Gunshots, something like a beast's roar, and human screams. Amid the clamor, she heard Ginevra's voice.
> "No matter what happens, don't leave Elysium. And..."
> Her final words were drowned out by a massive explosion from the street.

The [[2036 Disaster]] begins, casting the [[N109 Zone]] into months of chaos. [[Aislinn]] doesn't initially understand how/why she and [[Elysium]] remain unscathed:
> Not until a black crow delivered its master's message: "The deal is done. I'll be taking the map."
* ((The black crow is [[Mephisto]]))

**From [[WU-14 Elysium#05 Today's Special]]:**
[[Aislinn]] never saw [[Ginevra]] after that riot, but kept looking for her. She learned that [[Ginevra]] somehow got the map and traded it to [[Sylus]] for [[Aislinn]]'s protection, but she doesn't know how Ginevra got the map. She's intent on finding Ginevra and getting the answers herself.

Since then, Elysium has been an intel bar.

At the end of [[WU-14 Elysium]], [[Aislinn]] finds out that [[Phantom Thief Pea]] was the one who originally found the [[Protocore map]] and got it to [[Ginevra]], who then traded it to [[Sylus]] for protection of [[Elysium]] and [[Aislinn]].

**Commentary:**
Specifically, [[Ginevra]] traded the liquor cash [[Aislinn]] had originally given her, labeled as "Aislinn's Protection Money", to [[Phantom Thief Pea]] in exchange for the [[Protocore map]]. The map is priceless, but Pea has his rules of "exchange" for equal pain and equal joy. Essentially, he cared as much about protecting Aislinn (whether due to her specific identity or out of general sentiment) as he did about the priceless Protocore map. Remember that [[Ginevra]] specifically noted that the sum of cash from [[Aislinn]] wasn't even enough to buy a decent bullet--so she kept and traded it for its sentimental value.

Ginevra then traded the [[Protocore map]] to [[Sylus]] in exchange for protection for [[Elysium]] and [[Aislinn]], and potentially for him to stay on as the bar's sponsor indefinitely.

That he addresses her as "My dear Aislinn" and seems to pick out the frog plushie for her implies that he may have known her when she was younger, or otherwise has a sentimental attachment.
