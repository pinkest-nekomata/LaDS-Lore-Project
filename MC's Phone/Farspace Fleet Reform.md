> The Truth Behind the Farspace Fleet Reform

# Key Info

((Unlocked after [[04 Homecoming Wings]] is completed.))

> Recently, several regions have issued advisories against traveling to [[Skyhaven]], and the [[Hunters Association]] has suspended all operations at their [[Skyhaven branch]]. This follows the city being taken over by the [[Farspace Fleet]] after the explosion incident. The Fleet's extensive authority has sparked widespread speculation, and I have some thoughts to share on this matter.

> **The Biggest Misconception About the Farspace Fleet**
> For years, due to limited public information, the Farspace Fleet has been widely assumed to be associated with the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] (DAA). However, there is no connection between the two. The Farspace Fleet is neither a government entity nor a military subsidiary.
> The DAA operates under Skyhaven's Air Defense Department, focusing on near-space combat as our first line of defense against [[Wanderer]]s while conducting scientific exploration in the shallower parts of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]s.
> On the other hand, the Farspace Fleet explores much deeper into the tunnels, equipped with advanced cruising and combat capabilities. They've brought back newly discovered Wanderers and [[Protocore]]s, but their true mission remains a mystery.

> **The History of the Farspace Fleet**
> The Farspace Fleet first appeared in the public eye the year [[Skyhaven]] was completed, often mentioned as the energy provider for the massive floating city. After that, they faded into obscurity until they recently reappeared with a new Colonel. This Colonel's background is a total mystery. Even I can't dig up anything on him-he practically came out of nowhere.
