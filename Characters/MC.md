Birth year: 2026 or 2027

> "When I was younger, I had doubts about my past. Later I figured that so long as I was healthy and safe, none of it really mattered. But a human heart shouldn't contain a [[Protocore]]. I need to find out who I really am instead of waiting for mysterious people to find me."
> -- [[MC]], [[05-01.04 The Match]]

# Evol and Power Level
MC has the rare [[Resonance Evol]], which may be the only of its kind, and one of only a few [[Anhaunsen Class]] Evols. Her power level isn't readable, however.

In [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#06 Dust]], an [[Ever]] hitman and one of the [[Backtrackers]] turned traitor discuss that "her powers aren't complete yet", "The one who strikes first is helping her [[cultivation]]", and "[[Ever]] will end up losing more than they bargained for once she develops."

In [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], [[Sylus]] notes that her power is only a fraction of what it once was. ( #todo, more specific citation)

# Misc Info
* As a result of her trauma from the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], MC had "astrophobia" when she was younger, because the sound of thunder reminded her of the sound of [[Wanderer]] roars. Caleb would alway sit with her and helped her get over her fear. ([[04-01.05 Visitation]])

# Timeline

## Quick Reference

2026/2027: Born

2034: Experiments begin and end, [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], age estimate 7-8, likely enrolled in 3rd grade (Since she's noted as a fast learner, Josephine would likely err on the side of the higher grade)
* [[MC]] meets [[Zayne]] via his parents being friends with [[Grandma]] later this year or early 2035, when she's still 8. ([[01-01.08 Doctor]])
* If Caleb's experiment notes from [[Pathless Realm#05 Arrival]] are the same time as MC's, he's 9-10 in 2034. He can't possibly be younger than this, since we know there were no experiments on him after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. See below for further analysis and justification of the ages/grades shown below.

MC's university: [[Linkon University]]
Caleb's university: [[Aerospace Academy]]

### Caleb's age analysis
* [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]], specifically states that Caleb was 21 and a third-year student (Junior) at the DAA in midsummer 2044. So, he must have finished 3rd year and started 4th year in 2044.
	* Given his June birthday, he must have just turned 21.
* [[MC]] and [[Caleb]] overlapped 1 year in High School
	* [[Borrowed Promise]] shows memories of them both in High School at the same time, so they overlapped at least 1 year
	* Based on the dates from [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]], if MC graduates in 2048, then they must have gone to a 4-year high school to have overlapped a year.
		*  [[Skyline]] is pretty clear that MC is studying for the Hunter's Exam as graduation approaches, so there's no gap year.
	* [[Pathless Realm#05 Arrival]] isn't clear about when the experiments on Caleb are set, but based on Caleb turning 25 in 2048, he must have been 10 turning 11 in 2034.
* [[Summer's Echo]] specifically says Caleb is 17 *or* 18 between freshman and sophomore year of college
	* Though the memory is late summer, he'd have to be 18 turning 19 this year based on the dates in [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] and his About Him age.
	* By my analysis, it's more likely that the age comment in [[Summer's Echo]] simply isn't taking the timing of Caleb's birthday into account, and reflects that, like MC, his age isn't exactly certain.
* About Him indicates Caleb is 25:
	* The age given in [[WU-19 Serpent's Cast]] is consistent with Caleb turning 25 in June 2048.

Note: In China, 9th grade is typically middle school, with High School being 3 yrs (10-12th grade) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_China#Education_system)). Bachelors degrees are still typically 4 years. Academic year usually spans Sept to June, similar to the US. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_year#China))

## Details
MC was born in the depths of [[Deepspace]] ([[05-01.01 New Objective]]). She "arrived" at the [[Gaia Research Center]] as a result of their research into ancient civilizations and their power. ( #todo reference, there's something about what was found in the arctic)

Not being a regular human, she has no biological parents and no siblings. This remains true of all her Myth iterations as well.

The [[Gaia Research Center]] calls her "[[Unicorn]]" and "[[Subject 001]]" and they estimate her biological age to be 7-8 at the time of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] ([[Josephine's notes]]). The experiments on her energy levels began about 1.5 months before the catastrophe.

In [[Josephine's notes]] and [[Josephine's secret notes]], we learn that she she was originally in an experiment for "life form observation" ((which makes sense, since she could be considered an alien life form, having originated in Deepspace)), circa early summer 2034. Attributed to experiment error, her "energy values" rapidly escalated and resulted in an explosion of energy, after which she was medically dead. 14 hours later, she came back to life, albeit without her memories. Within days, she had regained all her cognitive function and then some, outperforming other children her age. The relief was short lived--the researchers voted to attempt to "kill" her again. Josephine ([[Grandma]]) protested, but the "experiment" proceeded anyway.

A larger energy burst occurred, and MC "died", then returned to life again. Parallels between this timing and what we know of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] itself foreshadowed the reveal in [[05 Death and Rebirth]] that these experiments are what caused the appearance of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] and the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] itself.

While MC is still in the observation unit, the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] begins, and the observation unit is crushed and MC escapes. Her nightmares of "rusty-red rain" recall this time, and she remembers being saved by [[Lumiere]] ([[Xavier]]). She ends up at a shelter where she has a brief encounter with [[Zayne]] (who makes her popcicles) which she then forgets, and also meets [[Caleb]]. We know from [[Josephine's secret notes]] that she also took in [[Caleb]] at this same time (though he's not specifically named there) and from [[Pathless Realm]] that Caleb was also an experiment known as [[Donor 002]]. Though they were at the lab at the same time, in [[04-02.10 Crossroads]], MC remembers their first meeting as being during the catastrophe.

Josephine then finds MC and [[Caleb]] in the shelter and takes them in. MC's childhood is relatively normal from this point forward, though she does still have memory issues, resulting in the [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]].

Especially in her Old Days memories with [[Caleb]], we can see she had a typical high school and college experience. She goes to [[Linkon University]]. [[Addictive Pain#03 A New Player]] also confirms her college experience is very typical, and she's not aware of all the groups keeping an eye on her.

She set her heart on becoming a [[Deepspace Hunter]], and passed the exams just before the main story begins. Based on the most likely timeline (see above), She graduated in spring 2048 and took the Hunter Exams right after.

# Trivia
* From a meta perspective, MC's uncertain birthday/age accommodates the player's selected birthday and ensures there are no narrative conflicts depending on the birthday picked.

# Theories

## MC and the Deepspace Tunnel
**Did MC's resurrections trigger the appearance of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]?**

This theory is CONFIRMED as of [[05 Death and Rebirth]].
* #todo specific references

We now know these details to be foreshadowing this reveal:

When the researchers go to "kill" MC a second time, they put her back in the observation unit. A close reading of [[Josephine's secret notes]] reveals that MC was still in the observation unit when the catastrophe hit, meaning that her "resurrection" may have actually been at the same time as the [[Wanderer]]s appeared. If we assume it took Josephine 3-4 days to find MC (the text says "days later"), then MC's first "resurrection" would align with the beginning of the 3 day "polar night" that [[Jeremiah]] notes in [[WU-04 From The Stars]].

Given the close tie of [[Philos]] with [[MC]]'s life and [[Aether Core]] described in [[Shooting Stars]], it's feasible that MC's death could "reach across time and space" in this way. And actually, as revealed in [[05 Death and Rebirth]], MC's origin is [[Deepspace]] making the appearance of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] and the [[converging timelines]] even more fitting.

This theory is also supported by [[Ever]] helping to fund [[Gaia Research Center]]. We know that some of the [[Backtrackers]] have turned traitor and are working with [[Ever]] and breaking the [[Nonintervention Principle]] (e.g. [[duckbill cap man]] in [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]]). Given that "Gaia" effectively means "Earth", and the [[Backtrackers]] are trying to find a way to save future-[[Philos]], their "observation project" may have been a way of trying to find a person/life form with [[Protocore]] energy compatible with [[Philos]], or even specifically [[MC]] herself (see also [[Queen MC]]). That being said, [[05 Death and Rebirth]] implies that Earth becoming [[Philos]] is only one of many "versions" of [[Philos]], and Ever's motives are more generic for power and immortality. ((See also [[The Fountain of Atei]].))

To take it one step further, the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] doesn't only represent a portal to [[Philos]], but also the [[converging timelines]]. Since [[MC]] is the center of all those timelines, her memory loss during the "death" could hint at a connection between memory in general and her "death". In the process of temporarily losing her memories, she may actually be accessing the memories of all her lives across the universe, becoming the convergence point of all the timelines. Josephine even says something along those lines, when she finds MC at the shelter, "...those forgotten days were always there, invisibly linking us together."
