# Summary
The patient is in critical condition, so Zayne prioritizes a surgery to remove the accumulating crystals. (He knows what will happen if they're able to grow.)

[[MC]] meets [[Captain Willow]] from the [[Chansia Branch]] of the [[Hunters Association]] and they share notes on the [[Wanderer]], which resembles a [[Myst]].

During the surgery, he and MC both spot a scale-like crystal just like the [[Wanderer crystal sample]] from the [[human-like Wanderer]]s in the [[N109 Zone]]. Once the last crystal is removed, a [[Metaflux]] fluctuation occurs, setting off alarms.

Unwilling to leave the patient, [[Zayne]] asks MC to regulate the [[Metaflux]] with her [[Evol]] and buy him time. She agrees.

## Commentary
Zayne is willing to put his life on the line for his patients, as usual.

# Details
A few hours later, they're at [[Chansia Hospital]] and [[Zayne]] discusses the concerning patient with their chief of surgery.
> Chief Surgeon: They're on ECMO. After the open-heart surgery, adhesions began to develop. And this morning, we saw the crystals spreading. They're very close to the lungs now.
* (("ECMO" is usually pronounced "ehkmoe" and is the formal name for a "heart and lung machine"--i.e. a machine is keeping the patient alive.([Mass General](https://www.massgeneral.org/heart-center/treatments-and-services/adult-extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo))))

Zayne says they'll need to go back into surgery ASAP. The chief surgeon worries the patient won't do well under anesthesia for as long as it will take to remove the crystals. Zayne insists it's the only option. ((He knows what happens if the crystals can't be stopped.))

A few hours later, they're in the OR. Many people observe. [[Zayne]] meticulously removes the many tiny crystals. 

[[Captain Willow]] of the [[Chansia Branch]] meets [[MC]] at the observation room, complimenting Zayne's bravery. They've worked together before on a previous visit MC took to [[Chansia City]]. Willow shares data on the Wanderer. It crossed the whole city in under five minutes, and seems to resemble a [[Myst]], but has different traits. MC guesses the [[Aether Core]] made it mutate.

Murmurs go through the observation room. MC recognizes the scale-like crystal currently being removed as identical to the [[Wanderer crystal sample]] from the [[N109 Zone]].

Just as the surgery is finishing, MC feels a fluctuation. The [[Flux Stablizer]] alarm goes off, and [[Captain Willow]] begins evacuation. MC urges Zayne to evacuate before a [[Wanderer]] appears. But Zayne and Greyson continue tending to the patient.

MC readies to deal with the [[Wanderer]]. The fluctuation dissipates, but she still feels tremors in her chest. She urges Zayne to evacuate again, but he calmly insists the patient won't make it and asks her to use her Evol to suppress the [[Metaflux]].

MC agrees, and Zayne asks for five minutes.
