# Summary
Interviewing the students gives only a couple of clues: all the attacks happened at night, and all to freshman. One of them was outside Dr [[Ulysses]]'s classroom, so MC and Xavier return the next day to scope it out.

While pretending to listen to Dr [[Ulysses]]'s lecture in the back, MC and Xavier chat about school and Xavier indirectly mentions [[When Shooting Stars Fall]]. [[Ulysses]] catches them chatting and calls on [[MC]] with a question about traversable wormholes.

# Details
[[Xavier]] and [[MC]] step into the room of students. They're wary and nervous. Distributing drinks helps ease the atmosphere a little.

[[Xavier]] suddenly starts talking as if he's a student, mentioning he forgot to sign in for his class. Since he gave his major as astronomy, an astronomy student asks if he's in Dr. [[Ulysses]]'s class. MC asks if he researched the professors, and Xavier claims it was just a random thing to say. ((However, we know from [[A Special Vacation]] and later in this story that [[Xavier]] and [[Ulysses]] are old friends and he probably does know Ulysses's class schedule. Xavier frequently lies like this.))

This helps the students relax, and one volunteers to tell his story first. But MC notices a brief blank look in his eyes after that. He ends up revealing that the incident took place outside of a classroom where Dr. Ulysses lectures. They interview the other five students, but don't find other clear patterns. They encountered the [[Wanderer]] in different places and reappeared in different places. But all the incidents happened at night, and all the victims were freshmen.

The next day, she and [[Xavier]] head to Dr [[Ulysses]]'s current lecture at that classroom. He's talking about white dwarfs and space-time. MC and Xavier quietly chat in the back. MC asks if he liked to sit in the back when he was in school--he says he didn't have a strong preference, but usually did sit in the back. ((Xavier went to school back on [[Philos]], when he first met [[Academy MC]], and the story is told in [[When Shooting Stars Fall]].))

They go through their notes on the case, [[Xavier]] reassuring [[MC]] that they'll find the pattern of the attacks eventually.

Dr [[Ulysses]] catches them chatting and calls on [[MC]], asking her to share what a Morris-Thorne wormhole is.
* ((This is a wink at the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. A Morris-Thorne wormhole is a type of traversable wormhole, where wormholes are theoretical space-time structures that essentially create "shortcuts" between distant space-time points.
