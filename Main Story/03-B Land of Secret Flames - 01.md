# Summary
[[MC]] realizes that her best course to pursue her lead, the wedding anniversary banquet of the wealthy jewelry appraiser [[Maxwell]] which will be held on a private island, is [[Rafayel]]'s connections. Though he's invited her over for a "concert" (that turns out to be a bunch of noisy seagulls), he's already guessed that she'll have need of him to follow her lead.

He mysteriously references that he'll need help from her for something only she can do, but then returns attention to her investigation.

# Details

[[MC]]'s lead is about a wealthy man, [[Maxwell]], who's been on the [[Hunters Association]] watch list. He has exceptional jewelry appraising skills, and is about to host a banquet for his wedding anniversary on a private island. Only celebrities are invited, so [[MC]] seeks out [[Rafayel]] to take advantage of his connections.

She finds him in his [[Rafayel - Phantom of the Siren]] outfit, attempting to conduct a group of seagulls in song. He gets them to squawk together by naming various snacks. Rafayel reveals that the game is a desperate attempt to cope with the noisy seagulls preventing him from working for the past few days.

Though he invited MC over for this "concert" and her tea, he has enough intel to already know she'd be coming to him about [[Maxwell]].
> Rafayel: Since you left the N109 Zone, certain "eyes" that lurk in the shadows are waiting for the play's next act. Problems keep coming up. I'm not sure which one you'll deal with first, though. Sooo, I'll take the initiative and off you a reward of your choice.
> *The rare display of honesty and underlying assertiveness catches me off-guard. He's already in control of the conversation.*

MC asks if there's something she should attend to immediately. He says "not necessarily", but it's something only she can do--though he implies it's better not to rush it, and suggests they talk about her issue first.
