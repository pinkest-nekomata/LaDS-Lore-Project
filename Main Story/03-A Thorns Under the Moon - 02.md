# Summary
[[Jenna]] reveals that a [[Wanderer]] with a [[Beta-Protocurve]] is active in [[Chansia City]] and is causing patients with [[Protocore Syndrome]] to go into coma/shock. [[Zayne]] has already been assigned to the [[Akso Hospital]] team supporting [[Chansia Hospital]], so [[MC]] volunteers to go as a hunter escort. Her mission is to search for traces of an [[Aether Core]].

As she goes to meet [[Zayne]] outside, [[Carter]] appears. He offers her white roses, gushing about meeting her, but also very persistent in trying to get her the flowers/etc. Zayne effectively shoos him off, but not before [[Carter]] gives a veiled threat.
## Commentary
Carter's behavior is very sus here. [[Carter]] and [[Zayne]] both worked under [[Dr. Noah]] in med school, and [[Carter]] wanted to recreate [[Zayne's research]]. He's been trying to recruit Zayne to project [[X-Heart]] at [[Xander Sciences]] for years, as [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs]] reveals, even though patients have [[black crystals]] growing in their hearts and eventually die anyway. During that story, [[Carter]] resolved to try to use [[MC]] to get to [[Zayne]], effectively holding him hostage for his surgical skills. 
# Details
At the [[Alpha Team]] office, [[Jenna]] shows [[MC]] a series of pictures with the same [[Wanderer]] that shows traces of a [[Beta-Protocurve]]. It's been spotted five times now. The images are blurred because it moves by distorting space.

The [[Intel Department]] discovered that where it appeared, many patients with [[Protocore Syndrome]] have fallen into a coma, some even going into shock. It's in [[Chansia City]]. MC remembers that the business trip she mentioned to [[Zayne]] was his plan to go to [[Chansia City]] to help with those same severe cases. Jenna already knows this, and mentions the [[Akso Hospital]] group going. MC volunteers to be the hunter escort. Jenna agrees. The [[Chansia Branch]] will also be investigating, and the goal is to find any traces of an [[Aether Core]].

As MC leaves, Zayne is waiting for her. Before she can head over, [[Carter]] (who she does not yet recognize) pushes a bouquet of white roses into her face, gushing about what an honor it is to meet her. He'd previously sent a business card and other flowers. He introduces himself as being with [[Xander Sciences]], and they got some of the [[Protocore]]s the [[Hunters Association]] recovered from the smugglers. He claims many patience were saved as a result. ((See also, [[X-Heart]]. [[Protocore]]s aren't safe to use in medicine, as [[Zayne's research]] revealed.)) He asks her out for dinner.

Zayne says she already has plans, having walked up to them. Zayne pushes away the bouquet, pulls MC to the side, and puts himself between her and [[Carter]]. Carter's expression darkens, but he tries to play it off, inviting him to dinner too.

MC professionally declines the dinner invitation. Zayne says, "Let's go." Carter still pushes the bouquet at her. Zayne takes them from Carter, looks at them, then hands them back, saying there's no room in his car.

Carter calls after them, following persistently. Finally, he says he's there to give a reminder/veiled threat. "The outside world isn't as safe as [[Linkon]]. Be careful when you're traveling."
