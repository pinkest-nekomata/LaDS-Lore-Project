> That night, the blood in his hands kept dripping onto the ground, dripping into his dreams. The summer when he was 12 was extraordinarily long.

 Commentary:
* Several different pieces of evidence point to the summer Zayne was 12 as being the year *before* the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. (See [[Zayne#Timeline]].) Additionally, the memories of the summer don't include the catastrophe, which would likely be mentioned if it had happened that year.
* However, this makes it a bit fuzzy as to when him losing control of his Evol nearly killed MC. This passage seems to draw a direct connection between the incident "that night" and the start of the dreams ("blood \[...] dripping into his dreams").
* Technically, [[MC]]'s whereabouts before the experiments in 2034 were unknown, so it's possible he did meet her before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]? But this seems unlikely.
* Or, he has only ever been referring to these nightmares which are more than just dreams to him. This is the most straightforward explanation, especially since [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon]] ties [[Zayne]] losing control of his [[Evol]] to [[MC]] being killed with [[black ice]].
	* Given that she's thought to have untreatable "[[Protocore Syndrome]]" Zayne may fear that the exposure will eventually cause her to transform.
	* #todo I need to track down/verify a reference that we know he ended up hurting her near a park and an ice cream truck? [[Nostalgic Sweetness]]

The [[Super Hunters Missions]] article identifies this issue as [[Unstable Evol]].
