# Meaning
## In EN
*Onychinus* is greek for "Of the claw/talon"
* Onych = "claw" ([Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onych-))
	* Note that this is the same root as in Onyx
* -inus = of/pertaining to ([WordSense](https://www.wordsense.eu/-inus/))

Greek references are recurrent throughout Sylus's lore, especially in the EN localization. "Tartarus" features in [[Tarus]] City, the name of the [[space-time prison]], and in the [[Tomorrow's Catch 22 AU]] as his [[Praedator]] name. And while [[Mephisto]]'s namesake Mephistopheles is from German folklore, the name itself is also derived from Greek. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephistopheles))

## In CN

CN: 暗點組織
MTL: Dark spot organization, Dark spot tissue
Alternatively: Dark Spot Network, Dark Node Web

暗點 means Dark spot, while 組織 can mean "organization" (likely the intended meaning) or "tissue". The Spacepedia entry reveals more about the intended meaning:
> CN: 紮根於N109區的神秘勢力。和區域性的黑色地帶不 同,暗點無處不在,暗線遍佈,構築起一張巨大的罪惡 之網,掌控著每一宗犯罪與不法交易。
> MTL: A mysterious force rooted in the N109 area. Different from regional black zones, dark spots are everywhere and dark lines are everywhere, forming a huge network of evil that controls every crime and illegal transaction.
> Localized: A mysterious faction stationed in the N109 Zone. Unlike other shady groups, Onychinus is omnipresent. They have connections everywhere, forming a vast web of sin to control every illegal activity.

Note specifically the repetition of 暗點 in "dark spots are everywhere", and 暗線 translated as "dark line" where 線 can also be understood as "wire", "thread", etc. So, the name "Dark Spot Organization" evokes this idea of dark spots and the "threads" that connect them, creating a "network". So, the name gives the sense of "Dark Spot Network", "Dark Node Web", that sort of thing.

This is mostly just included for reference and because it's an interesting tidbit, but it's noteworthy that the name in CN also emphasizes the sense of a vast interconnected network/web of operations, intel, etc.

# History

## 2036
[[Sylus]] had made it to the [[N109 Zone]] and [[Onychinus]] was established by 2036. ([[WU-14 Elysium#04 Strawberry Disaster Special]].) There were rumors of Sylus "eating people". At that time, Onychinus was still largely a solo endeavor:
> This powerful lone Evolver roamed the area and became a hot topic after "devouring" several prominent factions. Plenty of people wanted him on their side.
> "Eating people? What's that about?"
> "You heard about some Evolvers going missing, right? They say it all began after [[Sylus]]'s [[Onychinus]] came into existence."

## 2046
Ten years later, [[WU-10 Mischief]] provides some additional insight into the organization. By this time, [[Sherman]] is peacocking around with the backing of someone powerful. The narrative mentions many members of [[Onychinus]] arriving for an altercation at the [[fighting arena]], but it's implied that those members didn't survive.
