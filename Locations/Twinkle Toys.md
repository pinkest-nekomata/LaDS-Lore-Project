The in-universe toy company behind the claw machines.

There's a location in the [[Bloomshore District]] (500 Treeshade Road) that features in [[Xavier]]'s [[Plushie Go Go]] Bond. Since it's their opening day, this puts their opening circa late summer 2048 ([[Main Story Timeline Flowchart.canvas|Main Story Timeline Flowchart]]).

There are no main story mentions, but the franchise appears frequently in event content. Once the player has beat the final level of all Bounty Hunt levels, plushies of the bounty hunt bosses become available with an in-universe explanation.
