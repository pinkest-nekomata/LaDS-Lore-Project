**Description**
> In Xavier's storage room, I discovered an old camera covered in dust...

# Summary
MC and Xavier repair the vintage camera found in his storage room, then visit the flowers they planted the prior spring. Xavier packed a picnic with a tiny cake to celebrate the flowers' "birthday". The area is being turned into a park, so they collect flowers to transplant to a nearby ranch. At the ranch, they encounter sheep, then have a sweet moment flying kites. 

After spending the night, MC emerges to a new dress laid out for her and finds Xavier in his new outfit riding a white horse ([[Riceball]]). They head up the mountain to plant their flowers, talking about [[Traceback II]] along the way. The kindled scene depicts them enjoying the flower-filled mountain area. Back in Linkon, they develop the photos.

# Quotes

> Xavier: Most of the changes I've experienced recently are good. Someone planted these flowers with me. And after one winter, they sprouted and bloomed...

> MC: Xavier, why are you good at flying kites?
> Xavier: Maybe it's because this is like fishing. You just need to relax and wait. When the wind picks up, let out the string. Then pull it in as the wind dies down.
> MC: You seem to have a special talent for things that require patience.
> Xavier: It's similar to getting used to change. I wasn't born with it. Do it enough times and you'll figure out how it works after a while.

> MC: Did you always get what you wanted when you waited?
> Xavier: For the one time it mattered the most... yes.

> Xavier: I'm grateful we found this new field of flowers in the forest. The scenery I once saw by myself no longer exists only in my past... Because of these flowers, that scenery will be etched into our memories.

> Xavier: Just so you know, Xavier bites when he's provoked.
> MC: Interesting, I've never seen Xavier bite.
> Xavier: Come closer then, I'll give you a demonstration.
