# Quotes

> Sylus : Darkness… makes a person more sensitive.

> Sylus : Your body is hotter than your lips. You don’t have a fever, right?

> Sylus : …And just like that, you’re wet because of me.
> Sylus : I’m not proud. I’m just stating a fact.

> Sylus : It’s a tender, loving trap… I haven’t experienced this sort of hunting technique before

> Sylus : Hmm? Are you asking how to make your prey stay with you willingly after he walked into your trap? Kitten, you already know the answer…. Aren’t you an expert in this? To have a firm grasp on your prey, you should first make him lower his guard and get used to your intrusions. Then you tell him your heart’s desire. And when he’s a good boy, you reward him. For the last step… you reveal your vulnerable side to him. Do it in such a way that will make him think you’ll rely on him more… So when he leaves you, he’ll feel guilty. And do his best to make it up to you in every possible way. He’ll even give you everything you could ever want in this life.
