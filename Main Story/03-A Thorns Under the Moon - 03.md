# Summary
Driving away from the [[Hunters Association]], [[MC]] connects [[Carter]] back to the conversation she overheard between [[Raymond]] and [[Zayne]] in [[01-02.03 Powder Keg]]. Zayne is cagey about it. (([[WU-02 Snowy Stairs]] tells much of this story.))

Three days later, [[MC]], [[Greyson]] and [[Zayne]] all meet at the airport. Greyson reports a concerning patient with a different type of crystal in his heart ((later revealed to be [[black crystals]])) different form [[Protocore Syndrome]] that caused a [[Metaflux]] burst that didn't summon any [[Wanderer]]s.

[[Zayne]] arrives to tell them not to jump to conclusions, but he knows more than he's letting on.

## Commentary
It's pretty clear that [[Zayne]] is trying to deal with this himself (as usual) and not get [[Greyson]] or [[MC]] too involved. He's already seen [[black crystals]] around a patient's heart before--in [[Zayne's research]] and also in project [[X-Heart]] recently.

# Details
In the car, [[MC]] asks [[Zayne]] about [[Carter]]. She connects it back to the conversation she overheard between [[Raymond]] and [[Zayne]] in [[01-02.03 Powder Keg]]. Zayne confirms, but insists that they merely studied under the same professor. "The paths we're walking are completely different."

MC asks if there's bad blood, and Zayne says it's not interesting, which of course piques her curiosity. Zayne relents slightly, identifying the remark about traveling as a veiled threat.

Three days later, at [[Linkon Airport]], [[MC]] surprises [[Greyson]] and [[Zayne]] by showing up as their hunter escort. [[Greyson]] reflects that while the [[Akso Hospital]] team is being sent as an "academic exchange", it's pretty clear that things in [[Chansia City]] are bad and they're in need of help. One of the patients is particularly concerning:
> Greyson: His biopsy results show that the crystals in his heart have a certain shape and structure that's different from the ones you'd see with [[Protocore Syndrome]]. Also... when he was admitted to the hospital, he caused a [[Metaflux]] burst.
* ((See also, [[black crystals]], [[X-Heart]]))

It even caused all the [[Flux Stablizer]]s in the ER to go down. Greyson shows a video of chaos and flickering lights.

> *An abnormal heart, a sudden burst of [[Metaflux]]... a picture begins to form in my mind, something strangely familiar.*
* ((This is likely a reference to [[Josephine's notes]] and the [[Aether Core]] energy in her heart. Additionally, in [[Josephine's secret notes]] we learn that she released an energy burst that caused one researcher to call her "little bomb". It's unclear how much of this was in the notes that MC had access to.))

Greyson remarks he's glad no [[Wanderer]]s showed up, and MC informs him the [[fluctuation]] index only indicates the probability of [[Wanderer]] appearance, it's not a guarantee--but she agrees it's weird. She asks for the rest of the documents.

Zayne arrives, cautioning against jumping to conclusions. Zayne reaches between them and nudges [[Greyson]] aside, also putting his phone into sleep mode. He insists that [[Chansia Hospital]] is old, so that could explain the problem with the [[Flux Stablizer]]. And the patient's biopsy results need more analysis.

MC offers Zayne one of the pastries she bought. He asks if she's there for breakfast, and she reveals her suitcase. But Zayne isn't surprised at all--he even brought her coffee already.
> Zayne: Have you ever thought about who approved and signed your escort application and ID request?
