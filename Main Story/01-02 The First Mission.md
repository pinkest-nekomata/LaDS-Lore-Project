# Summary

These events take place over two days--day 2 and day 3 of the main story timeline. 

On MC's second day of work, she gets her first official mission assignment. Renowned art collector [[Raymond]] is behaving strangely, and [[MC]] is sent to search for any [[Wanderer]] activity. Along the way to the remote estate in the mountainous [[western suburbs]], she runs into [[Zayne]] who's also been called to assist [[Raymond]]. [[Raymond]] is a former patient with a serious congenital heart condition.

Upon arriving at the mansion, MC is struck by [[Raymond's Lemurian skeleton]], though she doesn't yet know it's [[Lemurian]]. As she searches, she overhears a conversation where [[Raymond]] tries to recruit [[Zayne]] to [[Xander Sciences]]. Just after Zayne leaves the collection room, there's a [[Metaflux]] fluctation. They rush back in to find [[Raymond]] unconscious and a [[Wanderer]] on the prowl.

After defeating the [[Wanderer]], MC identifies that [[Raymond's painting]] is suspicious. She has it brought back to HQ, where they confirm faint [[Metaflux]] traces. The artist turns out to be [[Rafayel]], so MC goes to investigate.

She meets [[Thomas]], learns about [[The Day of Ebbing]] and more about [[Raymond's painting]]. At the gallery, [[Flux Arts]], she finds suspicious blood red [[coral stones]] with [[Metaflux]] traces. Heading over to [[Rafayel's house (Mo Art Studio)]], she confronts him about the painting's strange effects. After dealing with a [[Wanderer]], [[Rafayel]] agrees to give MC information about the origin of the [[coral stones]]--but only if she agrees to be his bodyguard and help him find a suitable replacement first.

On her way home, [[MC]]'s train is attacked by a [[Wanderer]] and [[Jenna]] calls [[Xavier]] in to help her out, revealing he's part of [[Alpha Team]].
