# Details
In the elevator, MC learns that [[Xavier's apartment]] is on the floor above hers--he's on the 6th, she's on the 5th. In the background is an ad for [[Tumi Hotpot]].

[[MC]] nudges [[Xavier]] that it's suspicious that [[Xavier]] lives so close, even though a lot of hunters live in that area. He claims he's lived there for over 6 months, so [[MC]] is the suspicious one. Still, she presses about the [[N109 Zone]] information.
* ((Notably, if MC moved in before her first mission, MC would have moved in more than 6mo + 3 weeks ago, actually making [[Xavier]]'s choice of apartment VERY suspicious. Given that the writers like to hide little subtleties like this, it's fair to say it's a clue that [[Xavier]] DID pick this apartment to keep an eye on MC. However, it's also worth noting that something may have been lost in translation with the timing.))

MC admits that she does want to go to the [[N109 Zone]] and asks for more info. Xavier relents, offering to meet up the next day.
