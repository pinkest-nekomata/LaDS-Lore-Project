# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Sylus]] head to downtown [[Linkon]] and find [[Kovi]] in a spacious [[Kovi's gambling lounge]] inside an unnamed building. There, they play poker. Kovi is initially surprised to see MC, noting that Sylus prefers to work alone, to which he replies "nothing is impossible".

Unbeknownst to Kovi (and possibly also Sylus) MC knows more of the rules than she lets on, essentially allowing them to hustle Kovi, who calls Sylus's all-in bet, not realizing that MC knows she has a good hand.

With MC getting a straight flush, the whole pot is hers (and Sylus's). Kovi's bodyguard attempts to intervene, but MC quickly deals with him, disarming him and essentially knocking him out.

Sylus is impressed by her performance.

## Commentary

### MC's skills
[[MC]] is shown to be a quick learner in [[Captivating Lesson]], and that trend continues. Though she wasn't initially great at bluffing, as we see in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]] and [[Wild Gaze]], she's now come far enough to pull one over on an experienced gambler, even if that's primarily because he underestimated her.

MC is really stepping up to the plate here, working hard to prove to Sylus that's she's an asset, not a liability.

[[MC]] is surprised that [[Sylus]] takes her to downtown [[Linkon]], to a spacious [[Kovi's gambling lounge]].

> [[Kovi]]: Mr. Sylus, I thought you always preferred to be by yourself. Yet you brought a plus-one this time.
> Sylus: Nothing is impossible.
> *Every player's eyes focus on me. I force myself to stay calm and politely meet the sharp, emotionless gazes.*
> *Sylus pulls out a chair for me. He sits to my right.*
> *It doesn't take long for me to understand that when Sylus said they were playing cards, he actually meant he'd be talking business with the people at the table.*
> Kovi: We're in the last round of betting. I assume you're ready to make a decision, Mr. Sylus?
> *Sylus rolls a chip across his knuckles. Now I know that whenever he fiddles with something, his mind is quickly making calculations.*
> Sylus: What if I want to raise the stakes?
> Kovi: The key to playing cards is knowing when to quit.
> Sylus: I always like to put everything on the line.
> *Sylus tosses the chip in his hand into the pot. Then he pushes all his chips in front of him.*
> Sylus: All in.
> *Kovi's eyes darken. He slightly raises his hand from the table. I hear a faint click of a firearm being loaded.*
> *I immediately feel a chill run down my spine. I glance at Sylus. He looks at me with a faint, almost amused smile. He's waiting to see how I'll react.*
> Kovi: What about you, miss? It's not too late to fold.
> *Although I have no idea what business they're referring to, I can't lose face. I put on a relaxed smile.*
> MC:  You don't know what cards I'm holding, sir. Don't worry about me.
> *I push forward the chips on my side.*
> MC:  I'll call.
> Sylus: You're bold for a novice.
> MC: Ignorance is bliss.
> Kovi: Mr. Sylus's guest doesn't seem to know the rules.
> Sylus: Oh, but she didn't break any now, did she? And Mr. Kovi, if you can't make up your mind, perhaps someone else should play.
> *A hushed silence encompasses the room, but the tension is palpable in the eerie quietness. A silent struggle is about to occur.*
> Kovi: ...I'll call.
> *The three of us reveal our cards one by one. In my hand, the two cards and three community cards form a straight flush.*
> Sylus: Impressive.
> *I tug the corner of my mouth to create the most natural-looking smile I can muster. I make eye contact with each person at the table.*
> MC: Beginner's luck, I suppose. Thank you for going easy on me.
> *Kovi's eyes gleam like a venomous snake. The corner of his mouth is about to twitch. My gut tells me this seemingly spacious room is rife with chilling, murderous intent.*
> Sylus: All's fair in gambling, Mr. Kovi. Isn't that part of the rules?
> Kovi: Sylus, why did you bring a girl to meddle in our affairs?
> *Kovi's bodyguard stands behind me. As he's about to move, I quickly react, pushing back my chair to knock him down and start beating him up.*
> *The bodyguard is on the ground now. I hold the pistol he had on him. I swiftly remove the magazine from it, and the bullets scatter onto the carpet.*
> *Sylus's sharp gaze sweeps over my face, and I make eye contact without flinching.*
> Sylus: I forgot to mention she's no ordinary "girl." Oh well.
> *He stands up and joins me. Together, we smile at Kovi.*
> MC: It's been a pleasure playing with you today, Mr. Kovi.

Kovi's tone abruptly changes and he plays off the card game as being "trivial". Sylus agrees, but comments that the trip was worth it. ((The implication being it was worth it to see MC handle herself in that situation.))
