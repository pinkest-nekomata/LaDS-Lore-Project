# Spacepedia
The celestial body alpha-P0159 was discovered via the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. It's speculated to be the core of a star. While this core no longer reacts to energy, research suggests that traces of life may very well exist within its galaxy.
Using the most vibrant colors of Deepspace, the galaxy where alpha-P0159 resides responded to humanity's lifelong vision of the universe. This, it was named Philos, a word meaning "love".

((Note: CN has only one word to mean both "star" and "planet", so the phrasing here does *not* necessarily mean that the celestial body is the core of a star--see also [[celestial bodies in CN]]. Also, what is translated as "galaxy" here could also be "star system".))

# Other Info
The first in-story reference to this celestial body is during [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]], where it's specifically referred to as a "planet". In EN, this contradicts Spacepedia, but in CN the word for "star" is the same as for "planet". 

Its [[Sterre Energy]] has been depleted, which is consistent with the idea that "this core no longer reacts to energy".

Notably, the use of the Greek Philos for its name is identical in EN and CN.

## Origin
In [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], we learn that Earth was remade as [[Philos]]. Its "extinguished core" was replaced with a "powerful, artificial one". 
* Notably, this also implies that Earth somehow moved across space and time into the newly discovered star system, since [[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]] confirms that the [[Philos]] that [[Xavier]] left behind is in another galaxy than Earth is currently.
	* ((Could this hint at [[Ever]]'s interest in the [[Spatium Core]] which can displace even very large objects through space?))
* Given the theme of cores in [[Xianxia]] fiction, this should be interpreted as more of a metaphysical/energetic core, and not the literal molten center of the planet.

As shown in one of the main story cinematics (citation #todo), Earth literally broke apart into chunks separated by the vacuum of space. [[Academy MC]] refers to this as the "starry sea" in [[When Shooting Stars Fall#01 Distant Stars]]. Travel between these chunks, or "Plates", is difficult. It's the artificial core that prevents the Plates from drifting further apart--it literally holds the fragmented planet together.

Based on [[Xavier]]'s reflections in ([[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]]) where he looks at the sky and wonders if he can see [[Philos]], Earth must have also passed into that star system at the same time. ((What remains unclear is whether there are multiple parallel versions of [[Philos]] or not.))

## Geography
The planet is comprised of chunks, called "Plates", held together by the artificial core. There's the vacuum of space between them, making travel difficult. Clear skies are a rarity ([[When Shooting Stars Fall]]).

Known Plates:
* [[Academy]] Plate, a small one ([[When Shooting Stars Fall]])
