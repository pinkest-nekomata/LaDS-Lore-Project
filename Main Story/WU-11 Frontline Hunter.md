A look into [[Hunter Dispatch]] and [[MC]] and [[Xavier]]'s working relationship from the outside

# Summary
We're introduced to business as usual at the [[Hunter Dispatch]] center. Dispatcher [[Colin]] has been working this job for the past twelve years--since two years after the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]].

Many teams work together seamlessly to create this invisible safety net. Colin helps resolve a [[Wanderer]] attack in the [[Empyreal Ring District]], then another in the [[Bloomshore District]] where three young men are saved by the retired hunter they tried to rob.

In the third incident, another criminal calls in--[[Orson]], a repeat offender, is now in hot water for trying to pass off dyed rock candy as [[Protocore]]s. [[Colin]] attempts to gather the five hunters necessary for this threat level, but [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] quickly accept the commisison, rush in, and deal with it. [[Colin]] reflects on the impressive track record of [[UNICORNS]].

Finally, Colin finds himself on the other side of dispatch as [[Wanderer]]s attack when he's on his way home. He saves a young girl named Jenny, then watches as [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] quickly defeat the powerful [[Wanderer]]s before they can even deploy their [[Protofield]]s.


# 01 Hunter Dispatch Center

It's a typical day at [[Hunter Dispatch]].

In the middle of the night at the [[Hunters Association]], [[Colin]] handles an emergency call as part of [[Hunter Dispatch]]. Through the close coordination of the dispatch team, hunters are deployed and the threat is quickly neutralized.

Colin prepares an incident report:
> Case Number: LK204x01101
> Incident Type: [[Wanderer]] Attack
> Threat Level: C Class
> Details:
> A single Wanderer (an [[Elemental]] subspecies) appeared in the riverside area of the [[Empyreal Ring District]]. The target was neutralized, and the cleanup crew has been notified. No civilian casualties.
> Status: Resolved
> Reporting Dispatcher: Colin

# 02 Three-Man Robbery
[[Colin]] fields another call, but this caller is already panicking.
> "There are three of us... And an older lady with her groceries, We--"

They hear screams and [[Wanderer]] cries and fear the worst. The hunters have been deployed but are too far out.

Then they hear gunshots, a wanderer screech, and a thud--the Wanderer is dead. The people are okay--but the hunters are still en route.

> "That's it? And you call this a robbery? Luckily for you, I took my gun for maintenance while I was out getting groceries. Otherwise, you'd be in real trouble!" a confident female voice shouts.

It turns out, three young men were trying to rob the woman getting groceries when a Wanderer appeared. She turns out to be a retired hunter. Former sector DAWN, ID No. 10041.

Colin prepares another report:
> Case Number: LK204x01102
> Incident Type: [[Wanderer]] Attack
> Threat Level: C Class
> Details:
> Three young men attempted to rob a woman near a [[Bloomshore District]] market when a [[Wanderer]] (a [[Bestial]] subspecies) appeared. The would-be victim eliminated the Wanderer with her own Hunter-grade firearm. The woman was confirmed to be a retired Hunter. Cleanup is en route, and no civilian injuries were reported.
> Note: The three suspects have been turned over to the authorities for attempted robbery.
> Status: Resolved:
> Reporting Dispatcher: Colin

Colin realizes he missed lunch, so he grabs some instant noodles. His colleague gives him a hard time about it, but he says the Wanderers have been too active recently.

The colleague reports that the Wanderer surge is due to a [[Deepspace Tunnel]] anomaly or a [[Protocore]] malfunction.

Their conversation briefly references the [[Alpha Team]] and how they go on dangerous field missions and don't have a cafeteria.

# 03 The Counterfeit Protocore Case

[[Colin]] gets a call from [[Orson]], a repeat offender for [[Protocore]] smuggling. Colin saved his life before when he got too close to [[Wanderer]]s trying to get their [[Protocore]]s.

This time, he's passing off rock candy as [[Protocore]]s to buyers. Since buying is illegal, he doesn't get reported and his scam thrives, even disrupting the market with cheap prices. However, that's gotten him in big trouble, and he's now under attack by the criminals he scammed, who threaten him with [[Protocore weapon]]s.

Colin is obligated to help. He initiates the [[Emergency Response Protocol]], which is reserved for major threats. Due to the threat level, Hunters are not allowed to engage unless a group of five can be assembled. Colin is worried they'll be able to get enough Hunters together in time.

But the mission is accepted almost immediately, and two blue dots--indicating two hunters--charge in. Colin tries to stop them, but the surveillance officer realizes they're from [[UNICORNS]].

Orson sees them come in, saying there's eight or nine guys there--then watches the hunters swiftly take care of the problem.

Before the call hangs up, Colin hears MC say:
> "Xavier! Stop eating the evidence!"
* (he's munching on the rock candy)

Colin prepares another report:
> Case Number: LK204x01103
> Incident Type: [[Protocore]] Smuggling
> Threat Level: A Class
> Details:
> [[Shellbank District]]. [[Orson]], a repeat offender with eight [[Protocore]] smuggling charges, sought assistance from the dispatch center after facing retaliation from a crime syndicate over his sale of counterfeit [[Protocore]]s that were actually rock candy. The involved criminal organization has been successfully apprehended. Orson, the reporting party, has been handed over to the relevant authorities for investigation of fraud.
> Note: A portion of the evidence is suspected to have been consumed
> Status: Resolved
> Reporting Dispatcher: Colin

# 04 City Hero
[[Colin]] is leaving the grocery store [[Joysky]] at sunset when a Wanderer attacks. 

> For a moment, no one reacts. Then, massive figures emerge from the dust, their bodies covered in jagged [[black crystals]].

Thinking quickly, Colin leaps into action to save a young girl named Jenny. He calls the emergency in to [[Hunter Dispatch]], where the dispatcher instantly recognizes him and leaps into action.

The [[Wanderer]]s have bulldozer-like forelimbs and massive compound eyes. One looms over Colin and the girl.

With the ring of gunshots, [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] appear and deal with the [[Wanderer]]s. MC leaps onto a Wanderer and shoots it at point blank range while Xavier stabs it through a weak spot. They kill it before it can deploy its [[Protofield]].

As MC and Xavier leave, he see them pick up the hotpot ingredients they'd dropped.

The little girl thanks him for saving her, and he goes home to rest.
