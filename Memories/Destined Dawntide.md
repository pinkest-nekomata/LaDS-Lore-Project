**Description**
> As spatial anomalies keep appearing, the Hunters Association continues to send people out to investigate. This morning, I had just been assigned to check out one near the coast of Whitesand Bay when a message from Rafayel suddenly popped up on my phone: "Save me!!!"

# Summary
MC heads to [[Rafayel's house (Mo Art Studio)]] to investigate a spatial anomaly, only to find the house (temporarily) gone and Rafayel a castaway. They camp out, then discover ancient [[Lemurian]] ruins featuring carvings of the first [[Sea God]]. (([[Tears of Romirro]] confirmed that Lemuria had many Sea Gods and [[Rafayel]] is the last.)) That night, MC asks for stories of [[Lemuria]], then she dreams of it. 

They enjoy the "stranded on a desert island" life until the anomaly is close to expiring. At night, MC finds Rafayel sketching at the ruins and they talk about the history of Lemuria. The next day, Rafayel reveals the outfits he prepared for them and leads MC out to stand on the water as they talk about the Lemurian Covenant. A magical pink whale appears, and the swim off towards the horizon. 
# Key Info
* The entirety of the island that [[Rafayel's house (Mo Art Studio)]] is built on changes to a different landscape due to the anomaly.
* The [[Sea God]]'s power is cyclical, ebbing and flowing. At times it's dormant.
	* Rafayel: "Sometimes, only a few years pass between a [[Sea God]]'s passing and their successor's birth. Other times, it can take centuries."
	* Ironically, MC asks if there's a Sea God in the current era and Rafayel dodges, saying it's ancient history.
* Rafayel does several art projects, including painting waves on an old wooden boat and preparing a beautiful glowing light paint display inside their tent, meant to mimic the "[blue tears](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/china-blue-tears-red-tides)" phenomenon
* In MC's dream of Lemuria, she sees a young [[Sea God]] who cradles Lemuria's [[sacred flame]] and then holds it to her heart.
* In recounting some of Lemuria's history, Rafayel says that he doesn't really believe in legends.
* When MC infuses one of the [[flame lillies]] with Rafayel's fire, this is symbolic of a [[Lemurian]] covenant.
* The [[little blue fish]] that becomes MC's ring is a reference to [[Rafayel's scale]].

# Trivia
* Rafayel originally wanted to explore a spatial anomaly for inspiration.
* MC has a boing-fish-shaped massage hammer
* [[flame lillies]] are found growing on the spatial anomaly
* An arc of light on the horizon seems to indicate the strength of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] fluctuations that sustain the spatial anomalies.

# Quotes

Looking at the relief of the first [[Sea God]]:
> MC: This is [[Lemuria]]'s Sea God... What an imposing, majestic person.
> Rafayel: You know... there's also a young, good-looking one.

> Rafayel: Every sunrise is accompanied by a sunset. Likewise, the Sea God slumbers and awakens with the ebb and flow of his power. But when his power is gone, he fades away and dissolves into the sea.

> Rafayel: Sooo, my darling, delicate human, does this meet your survival requirements?

While MC is blindfolded:
> MC: Just so we're on the same page, don't lead me into spooky caves or dump me onto a dolphin's back, okay?
> Rafayel: I haven't done any of those since I was ten.
> MC: I wouldn't be so sure about that...

> Rafayel: Siigh. You know, you're getting really comfortable with bossing me around. Too comfortable, in fact.

> Rafayel: Don't you think it's contradictory? I know nothing lasts forever, but I still want to keep trying.

> Rafayel: I want to capture more moments, every single second of being "stranded on an island" with you. I want to preserve it all.

> Rafayel: My fire combined with your flower... It's anything but simple.

> Rafayel: If this vow actually represents eternity, will you give me the chance to prove myself worthy of your devotion?

> Rafayel: From now on, the ocean's waters flow for you.
> MC: And to my [[Sea God]], I will offer my most sincere devotion.
