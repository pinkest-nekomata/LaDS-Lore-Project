[[Immobilized]] goes into more detail, revealing that the linkage is influenced by MC's emotions. The length of the linkage gets longer each time because MC is becoming more fond of Sylus--and vice versa. It's not her wanting to push him away that triggers it to get shorter, but the flicker of sadness she has at the idea of pushing him away.
* I've seen a suggestion that the appearance of Sylus's black mist in the linkage this time could indicate that it's his power that originally manifested it this time (vs MC's, which is more golden, as seen in [[02-02.12 Resonance's Power]]). This is compelling but needs more supporting evidence imo.

In [[Alternative Darkborne]], [[MC]] seems to consciously summon the linkage to create a chain of datura blooms wrapping their hands, reminiscent of a hand-fasting.

A potential cafe dialogue option from Sylus is “The more we go through together, the stronger our evol linkage gets and I wouldn’t have it any other way”.
