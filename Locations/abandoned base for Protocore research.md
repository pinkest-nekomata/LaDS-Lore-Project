The first location where a [[Flux Nexus]] is found, though at first they identify it simply as a mysterious stele.

This location is a setting in [[01 Under Deepspace]] 01 To Begin.

[[MC]] and [[Tara]] (along with unnamed other hunters) are sent to this location under supervision of [[Jenna]] due to a recent [[Metaflux]] explosion. Though the scanner indicates [[Wanderer]]s only of the C-B level, [[MC]] identifies the explosion aftermath as being of a higher risk level.

While [[Tara]] scouted the perimeter, [[MC]] heads inside and soon finds [[Xavier]] asleep and recovering there. ((Presumably, he's been fighting for quite a while, especially since he claims to have been sleeping during the explosion.))

As they deal with the [[Luminivore]] problem, [[MC]] suspects that the base was set up as a trap for [[Xavier]]--hence the high population of [[Luminivore]]s, which eat light and can respawn using it. Notably, Luminivores also do not cause the usual [[Metaflux]] fluctuations, explaining why the [[Hunter's Watch]] did not register the full threat level.

Xavier informs MC that she's been trapped with him since she entered the warehouse, and [[Tara]] confirms this later. She's not able to detect MC's signal or communicate with her until the Luminivores are taken care of.

Conjecture:
* Xavier's presence at the warehouse before MC and Tara were sent in may or may not have been known to Jenna. Xavier works with the [[Hunters Association]], but also does a lot on his own. So, Jenna may have been sending in backup, or it may just be that once the explosion occurred, the rookies were sent in as a standard procedure.
