# Summary
MC gets home and has a brief call with [[Caleb]] about her first day as a [[Deepspace Hunter]], and we learn he's in the [[DAA]] doing top secret missions. A storm occurs despite no rain in the forecast, and it's the first appearance of [[the giant red eye]].
# Details

MC finally gets home. There's thunder despite no rain in the forecast.

[[Caleb]] calls, though he should be on a "military flight operation". (This would be the [[DAA]], which is confirmed later in the call.) He reports things wrapped up early.

MC asks if he encountered any [[Wanderer]]s in the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], then reminds him they have plants to see [[Grandma]] at "the end of the month".
* Based on [[Zayne#Timeline]], this call happens in mid July 2048. ((Zayne took over MC's case in January ([[WU-02 Snowy Stairs]]) and [[01-01.08 Doctor]] occurs 6mo later.))

After the call wraps up, MC heads over to the window where it's actively raining.

"Outside my window, separated only by glass, a giant eye turns to meet my gaze."
* (([[the giant red eye]]))

She blinks, then it's gone.

"The overwhelming darkness of the night envelops the nearby buildings. A storm rages on, swallowing all the light in [[Linkon]]."
