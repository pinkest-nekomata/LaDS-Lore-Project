# Key Info
> Case No. 2: Unstable EvolÂ   
> In Episode 11, "The Girl You Can Never Meet," we meet a new Super Hunter with the Mimicry Evol. Her powerful Evol allows her to imitate any object she approaches, but she is unable to maintain her original form due to her Evol's overwhelming strength. This rare condition, known as [[Unstable Evol]], typically emerges when one overuses their Evol. It subsides when the Evolver calms down. However, if the Evol is inherently aggressive, it can harm them. Currently, there's no definitive medical treatment for this.
* Compare to [[Zayne losing control of his Evol]]
