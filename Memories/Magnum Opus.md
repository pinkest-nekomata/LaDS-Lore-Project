# Transcript (abridged)

It's the weekend and MC is recharging after a few busy weeks of work. The night before, she got home after dawn.

Sylus calls to ask if she has any plans, and there’s a roundabout back and forth as he suggests plans and she shoots them down. She finally asks if he’s trying to get her out of the house.

> Sylus: I used every trick in the book, yet a certain smart hunter won’t take the bait. I wonder what could possibly convince her to go outside.
> MC: If you’re patient, you can wait until next week when that hunter has another day off.
> Sylus: Patience is a rare commodity when you live in a world centered around “survival of the fittest.
> MC: Sylus, if you want to see me, you can just say so.
> Sylus: Kitten, I’d rather save face and maintain my pride. Besides, I thought I was being obvious about it.
> MC: If you want to ask someone out, you need to say it.
> Sylus: I sent you the address. See you soon.
> MC: …H-hey!
* ((Sylus is clearly being ironic about maintaining his pride here--he's very indulgent to MC for the rest of this memory.))

He texts the address after he hangs up. She almost replies, “I want to see you too”, then deletes it, musing that "It seems everyone has to “save face” every now and then."

MC then arrives at a restaurant with only a few customers, and he's sitting in a booth by the window.

> Sylus: Before you ask, I know the owner. I promised to bring someone, and it wouldn't look good if I kept putting it off.
> MC: Between lying and rushing to explain yourself, you're less composed when you do the latter.
> Sylus: Sure, but that explanation was necessary.
> MC: Is that why you want to see me here? What would you have done if I still didn't want to go out?
> Sylus: Well... You know how very persuasive I can be when I want something.
> MC: And how exactly would you persuade me? Will you roll around on the floor while throwing a tantrum?
> Sylus: `(laughs, amused)` Under certain circumstances, I might do that.
> MC: Don't forget you have a reputation to maintain.
> Sylus: Me? Give up the chance to see someone I want to see for the sake of my reputation? I wouldn't do such a thing. On the other hand, a certain lady I know kept making excuses when I asked her out.
> MC: Sylus, I ate a big lunch today. I finished all the dishes, had soup, and even ate dessert.
> Sylus: You were that hungry? Should I order...
> *Sylus stops mid-sentence as he understands what I'm implying. Despite being full, I still went to the restaurant he invited me to.*
> Sylus: Never mind. Why don't we go hiking in a few days?
> MC: Why hiking?
> *He takes out his phone and pulls up an image of a poster he saved from who knows where. Then he slides his phone over to me. It's a pink promotional poster featuring a photo of a temple on a mountain. It's located on the city outskirts. There's also flashy text. "Your wishes will come true! Visit us with that special someone!*
> MC: Is this another friend of yours? You really do have connections everywhere.
> Sylus: I just happened to see it while passing by. I don't have any special connections with deities who concern themselves with "matchmaking".
> *As I look at the screen, I notice Sylus's gaze flitting between me and the poster. Deliberately, I give his phone back to him.*
> MC: Given your line of work, wouldn't it make more sense for you to pray to a deity of war or something?
> Sylus: Oh, but that would suit you, too. We could go together.
> MC: You really want me to go with you, huh? But you need to be a little more sincere when you're asking someone out.
> Sylus: ... `(clears throat, leans closer)` 
> *Sylus puts away his phone. As if resigning himself, he slightly lowers his voice.*
> Sylus: I want to ask you out, but I'm not exactly devout to any deities. If you accompanied me, you could help me explain myself to them, right? I'd like to receive a blessing on a... match predestined.
> MC: Are you sure you want me to do the talking? I might've unknowingly offended the deities at some point.
> Sylus: What do you mean?
> MC: They arranged an ill-fated relationship for me.
> *With an exaggerated display of despair, I nod.*
> Sylus: I'll tell these deities that I want our "ill-fated relationship" to have a happy ending.
> MC: You're very stubborn. Aren't you worried the deities might punish you for it?
> Sylus: If I get struck by divine lightning while praying, remember to dodge.
* ((This is also an indirect reference to [[Sorceress MC]]'s [[Heavenly Tribulation]] in [[Beyond Cloudfall]]. That Sylus is able to joke about such things shows he's feeling more comfortable with MC.))
> MC: Don't even think about it.
> *When our drinks arrive, neither of us notices. We're too focused on the gentle smile on each other's faces.*

They head to the mall to buy hiking gear. MC asks whether Sylus might get recognized, so he puts on a ball cap and sunglasses to humor her. ((Notably, he doesn't disguise himself in memories like [[Melodic Weave]].))
> Sylus: You can pretend to chase me, and we'll act out a cat-and-mouse game.
> MC: The cat would like to request a day off. She hopes you can stay low-key.

They head through the stores, getting trekking poles and binoculars. Sylus comments they'll also need a tent. MC points out that the city outskirts are just a day trip.
> Sylus: But I haven't gone camping in ages, kitten. Spending the night on the mountain wouldn't be a bad idea.
> MC: We'll be hosting a charity event for mosquitos if we camp during this time of year.
> *Noticing the expectant look on Sylus's face, I trail off as I change the subject.*
> MC: Come on, let's check out that shop over there.

They arrive at a sportswear store and MC gives an approving nod to a male mannequin wearing the latest collection.
> Sylus: You like it?
> MC: Yeah, this is what you call a perfect figure. It probably looks good in anything, right?
> Sylus: Ah, so you prefer the silent type.

Option 1: Yep
> MC: Yep. 
> *I pat the mannequin on the shoulder.* 
> MC: This is my new boyfriend. I'll let you say hello to him.
> *Sylus walks up to the mannequin and measures their heights against each other.*
> Sylus: Won't you consider getting a different boyfriend, kitten? My figure is clearly better than his and in terms of height, I'm a head taller than... Actually, your boyfriend doesn't even have a head.

Option 2: Are you jealous?
> MC: Are you jealous? I'm just complimenting its figure.
> Sylus: What makes you think I'd be jealous of a plastic mannequin?
> MC: You haven't noticed? The air is thick with... jealousy.
> Sylus: `(laughs)` And here I thought I could guess your preferences. I never expected them to be so... unconventional.

> MC: Someone's sulking. You're not jealous because I complimented the mannequin, right?
> Sylus: `(laughs)` Yes, yes, I'm green with envy. But it's fine. I just saw a girl who's exactly my type.
> MC: What did you say?
> Sylus: Look. She's right behind you, kitten.
> *I quickly turn around. I see a mirror that reflects my irritated expression.*
> Sylus: `(laughs)`
> MC: Hmph!

MC heads over to the women's section, and Sylus casually follows.

> Sylus: Are you mad? Can't I say that I like how you look today? Oh, right, I almost forgot. You thought I was talking about someone else. `(teasing)`
> MC: (...You stinker!)

MC ignores him and pretends to be focused on the sportswear, but when she heads to the fitting room, he intercepts and scoops up everything to go buy it, adding some pieces he likes as well. He tells her that if she's tired she can go sit down and wait for him. She tells him to at least check the price tags, and he says he doesn't need to.
> Sylus: Give me a chance to show you what your mannequin boyfriend can't do.

Sylus comes over with the bags, teasing MC that she's looking at him like he did something scandalous.
> MC: If other people saw you with all these shopping bags, they'd be even more shocked than me.
> Sylus: Then why don't you consider working for [[Onychinus]], kitten? I win the Boss of the Year Award in the [[N109 Zone]]'s annual awards ceremony every time.
> MC: Would anyone in the N109 Zone dare vote against you?
> Sylus: Working with me comes with more than just a good salary. There are plenty of benefits. Guaranteed paid vacation, stock dividends, you name it.
> MC: How can I apply, then? are there any certifications I need to get?
> Sylus: `(laughs)` You're actually taking this seriously, huh. Hm, your shoelace is untied.
> MC: ?
> *Before I can bend down, Sylus is already kneeling in front of me.*
> MC: It sounds like you rehearsed this before. You must be desperate.
> Sylus: I only need one person. And that is you. Everything else is negotiable.
> MC: Is there an age cutoff? Can I apply after I retire from being a hunter at the Association?
> Sylus: Do I *have* to wait until you retire, kitten? I'll be a cranky old man by then. I'll be so old that I have to worry about eating my teeth when I eat soft cookies. ...There, it's done.
> *After tying my shoelace into a perfect bow, Sylus looks up at me and takes my hand.*
> Sylus: That's why we should seize the moment. There's no point in waiting until flowers have withered.
> MC: ...
> *The gaze that usually sees through human hearts now reflects only sincerity as it meets mine.*
> MC: I should join the dark side, huh? I need some time to think about it.
> *I smile as I pull my hand back. An instance of fleeting disappointment flashes in Sylus's eyes, but it vanishes just as quickly as it appears. Maybe he doesn't press for an answer because those words were casual remarks in the end.*
* ((They were not casual remarks. Ma'am. Please.))

> Sylus: Let's go. I'll take you home.
> MC: Sylus, I want to stay here for a while longer.
> *I haven't recovered from yesterday's mission. Not to mention, I went on a shopping spree today. My legs are killing me.*
> Sylus: They still hurt?
> MC: ... You noticed? (So that's why he told me to sit down earlier...) Yesterday's mission had me running around all night... I haven't gotten a chance to properly rest today either.
> Sylus: You can say 'no' when I invite you to go out next time...
> MC: I didn't expect you to have more shopping stamina than me. Besides... Don't you want us to spend more time together?
> *Sylus falls silent for a moment. Then he adjusts the brim of his cap before turning his back to me.*
> Sylus: Come on, I'll carry you. While I still can, that is.
> *A gentle breeze flows through the spacious, bustling shopping district. From my vantage point, I can see boutiques lined up one after another. I wrap my arms around Sylus's neck and lean into him. I feel at ease. His shoulders are broad, and his strides are steady.*
> MC: I never noticed this before, but the view is better from up here. No wonder people like to stick their heads out of the car.
> Sylus: In that case... I'm a limited edition luxury sports car. Only one of me exists in this world.
> MC: Your engine's pretty loud.
> Sylus: Is that so? Maybe you need some in-car music? My current playlist has--
> *I quickly cover his mouth with my hand.*
> MC: Lil S, navigate home.
> Sylus: `(laughs)`
> *We pass by a store that sells skincare products. My attention is immediately drawn to a flamboyant poster on the display window.*
> MC: Wait, wait, wait. Stop.
> Sylus: What is it?
> MC: I saw something interesting. Back up. Okay, you need to back up some more. Over there.
> *Sylus turns around and returns to the poster. He's still carrying me on his back.*
> MC: They have a buy-one-get-one-free deal for facial masks today.
> Sylus: Do you want to go inside?
> MC: Only if that's okay with you.
> *In the display window's reflection, I can see the affectionate helplessness in Sylus's expression.*
> Sylus: Then buckle up.
> MC: Huh?
> Sylus: Hold on tight.
> `The bell on the door is heard.`
> Sales Assistant: Welcome! What can I help you with today? Oh. Please, sit here.
> *The sales assistant pulls up a stool, and Sylus puts me down on it. Then he bows and playfully assumes the role of an attentive butler.*
> Sylus: What would you like today, my lady?
> MC: I'll take this one, that one, and the one over there. Please and thank you.
> *Sylus picks up the facial masks and skincare products I pointed to. Then he walks past me as I try to pay.*
> MC: ...This is the second time you've done this. At least let me pay once!
> *He glances at the phone in my outstretched hand.*
> Sylus: Save your money for the gas.

They leave the store and the sales assistant says goodbye. MC carries their bags as Sylus carries her.
> MC: You've been carrying me on your back for a while. Aren't you tired?
> Sylus: If you feel that guilty, then let me rest at your place later.
> MC: Really? Sure, that works. You overstayed your welcome after the sun set last time as well.
> Sylus: Ah, yes. Your sofa and hard floor are incredibly comfortable to sleep on. I'd definit3ely give up my custom-made luxury mattress for them.
> MC: Are you coming over or not?
> Sylus: `(warmly)` Of course I am.

On the way to the parking lot, Sylus sets MC down on a bench while they wait for the light to change. She invites him to sit next to her, and he does.
> MC: Sylus, I don't think we've done this much before. You know, just having a date for the sake of it.
> Sylus: Is this a new kind of compliment?
> MC: Tell me. What were you thinking when you first met me?
> Sylus: Don't you remember what I said back then? Well... allow me to put it in simpler terms. At that time, I thought we were like flowers. We were meant to grow together in the same soil. Yet you were quietly moved to another garden in a foreign land... Still, you... managed to bloom beautifully.
> MC: Then we met again. And here we are. What a wondrous fate.
> Sylus: It's a cruel twist of fate.
> *The traffic comes and goes like waves lapping against the shore.*

They wait through several light cycles before Sylus picks her back up.
> MC: What if people in the N109 Zone shear about Sylus, Onychinus's leader, carrying a girl on his back through a shopping district?
> Sylus: Let them talk.
> MC: Aren't you worried about your reputation?
> *Sylus glances at me, and there's amusement in his gaze. It's like I said a funny joke.*
> Sylus: Don't... let them know you compared me to a plastic mannequin, kitten.

They make it back to MC's apartment.
> Sylus: Your place is still as bare as ever.
> MC: If I had known you were coming, I would've rolled out the red carpet.
> *Sylus sets me down on the sofa and gets us both a glass of water. He knows exactly where everything is. He hands me the glass, but he's still standing.*
> MC: Are you looking for something?
> Sylus: Your closet.
> MC: Why? It's not like you'll find anything that fits you.
> Sylus: Don't worry. I just want to put the clothes I bought you in a more prominent place. That way you'll think of me whenever you see them.
> MC: You know, my neighbor's puppy snuck into my apartment when I opened the door the other day. It left paw prints all over the sofa and carpet. Even though I cleaned up the mess, I can still imagine that puppy as if it visited me only yesterday.
> Sylus: Are you saying...
> MC: I understand why you'd do something like this. Certain cute animals need to leave a mark in flashy ways to show how important they are.
> *I meet his gaze with a look of defiance. Rather than openly show our feelings for each other... Sylus and I prefer finding creative ways to leave deep impressions in each other's hearts at this very moment. Neither of us cares whether these "marks" come from childish banter or something else. As long as they remain, they'll always remind us of each other. I find myself in deep contemplation about this. Then I notice how Sylus is suddenly right next to me.
> He cups my cheek and studies me. When I try to move away, he catches my chin and pulls me back to him.*
> MC: What do you think you're doing?
> Sylus: I believe someone just compared me to a puppy.
> MC: You also look like me when I was stacking those Pile It UP blocks at your place.
* ((This is a reference to [[Greedy Heart]].))
> Sylus: Tell me, is the way I mark my territory... effective?
> MC: Sylus, you're copying me.
> *Sylus chuckles and leans in, his forehead almost touching mine.*
> Sylus: How will you respond?
> MC: Compared to your declaration, mine just isn't as deep and straightforward.
> *I point to a shopping bag on the table. It has the facial masks I bought today.*
> MC: Since you carried me home and bought all this stuff for me, I should repay your kindness. You care about "saving face", right? Maybe it's time to take care of it. Literally.
> Sylus: Ah, so people do return the favor. I guess those inspirational posts aren't a bunch of lies.
> MC: Hey, don't you start--
> *Sylus stands up. He grabs the facial masks and pulls me into the bathroom before I realize it.*
> MC: ?!

Kindled scene:
> `MC sits on the counter. Sylus approaches with the jar of facial mask in-hand, sets it on the counter next to her, then braces his hand there and leans over her.`
> MC: You're making yourself at home in my bathroom.
> Sylus: Isn't this the most suitable place to take care of my skin? `(Closes his eyes)`
> MC: Hmm... Where should I start?
> `MC gently trails a finger down his nose, and Sylus opens his eyes and nips at it.`
> Sylus: What a gentle touch... are we sure that was you?
> `MC gently brushes his throat and Adam's apple with her fingers. Sylus sighs, then grabs her hand. He draws her pointed finger across his throat.`
> Sylus: You need to strike this spot if you want to take me out silently.
* ((Sylus is emphasizing here that he's willing to be vulnerable with MC. As someone used to looking out for himself, letting someone touch him there requires a lot of trust.))
> Sylus: Done playing around? `(picks up the facial mask)` I can't wait.
> `MC takes the jar and shakes it.`
> MC: Close your eyes and hold still. Can you do that for me?
> `Sylus closes his eyes and MC applies the face mask (fade transition). She adds cucumbers under his eyes.`
> Sylus: Slightly cool... and softer than I expected, to be honest.
> MC: Does it feel nice? Do you want me to send you home with a few facial masks?
> Sylus: I was talking about your fingers.
> `Sylus looks at himself in the mirror, appearing vaguely embarassed but in good spirits.`
> Sylus: You--
> `(He picks up the jar, looking at her mischievously. MC pushes off the counter.)`
> Sylus: Don't run away, kitten. It's only fair that I return the favor.
> `(He pulls her back to face him. She pushes him gently away, trying to make a break for it again. She makes it a few steps before he catches her and pins her against the wall.)`
> Sylus: Leaving already? Won't you check your work?
> `MC reaches up to touch his face, and there's another fade transition. His face is clean now, and she cradles it in her hands, examining him.`
> Sylus: Well?
> MC: It's a work of art. Whoever created this must be a true master of their craft.
> Sylus: That so? Surely the virtuoso is fond of her magnum opus?
* ((In [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 4]], Sylus mentions that as a fiend, what people see when they look at him is influenced by their own hearts. She asks if he can guess what she sees when she looks at him, and he comments that he's at least more handsome than he was in the "Fiend-Slaying God" mural. So, in a way, MC is literally responsible for him looking the way he does. (In the main story timeline, Sylus seems to have a fixed appearance.)))

> MC: Of... course.
> `Sylus cradles her cheek, looking tenderly down at MC.`
> Sylus: If you were also an art piece, then whoever created you... must have loved you dearly. How else could every expression of yours be so enchanting?
 
Kindled scene ends.

> *The evening light dims. It's time for Sylus to leave.*
> MC: You remember when we're going hiking, right? You better not stand me up.
> Sylus: Don't tell me you forgot about the excuses you made when I asked you out. Now you're worried I'll forget? I wouldn't call myself a saint. But I'm not horrible enough to stand someone up.
> `The door is heard.`
> *I walk Sylus to the door. He takes one step before suddenly turning back around.*
> Sylus: Do you like anything in particular? I'm talking about... things that would make you come running as soon as you smelled them.
> MC: Sir, I'm a hunter, not a dog. For dates the like, just text me. And given our current relationship... I'll come to you.
> Sylus: We're dating now? Should I bring roses next time?
> MC: Sure. Bring the ones with the most thorns. My fingers can handle it.
> Sylus: `(laughs)`
> *He keeps saying he should leave, but I"m not rushing him. He's not walking away either.*
> MC: Since you asked... what would make you drop everything to visit me? After all, the N109 Zone is enough to keep you busy every day.
> *Sylus pauses as if to think carefully about his response.*
> MC: Is it a tough question?
> Sylus: No. What I'm implying is that you can try anything.
> MC: How so?
> *He leans against the doorframe and slightly bends down to look at me.*
> Sylus: You could say... you want to watch the snow fall in the mountains on the equator with me. Or... catch dragonflies in the snow together. Maybe you'll have the sudden urge to see the Milky Way with your own eyes at 1 AM... I'll have our camping gear ready and immediately pick you up for that one. No matter how outrageous your reason might be, I'll do whatever you want with you.
> *My heart flutters as if a thousand butterflies have taken flight, and I find myself gripping the doorframe without realizing it.*
> MC: I see. I'll have to put that to the test next time. Let's see if you keep your word.
> Sylus: You can test me as many times as you like.
> *Sylus's bold gaze exudes confidence. He's certain every promise he makes won't be broken.*
> Sylus: Nothing could possibly make me happier.
