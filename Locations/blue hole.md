This is a real-world occurrence. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hole):
> A **blue hole** is a large marine [cavern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavern "Cavern") or [sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole"), which is open to the surface and has developed in a [bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_\(geography\) "Bank (geography)") or island composed of a [carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate "Carbonate") bedrock ([limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") or [coral reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef")). Blue holes typically contain tidally influenced water of fresh, marine, or mixed chemistry. They extend below sea level for most of their depth and may provide access to submerged cave passages.

The deep blue color occurs due to the refraction of light through the water and the bright white sand lining the formation.
