Eccentric, rule-breaking twins who enjoy playing pranks. They often wear masks that conceal their faces, so it's difficult to tell the two apart. However, upon closer inspection, one can discern the vivacious and unpredictable nature of the older brother, Luke. This contrasts with the comparatively calm and dependable personality of his younger brothr, Kieran.

# Other Info

When the Main Story begins, they're 18. Sylus took them in two years prior, when they were 16. ([[World Underneath - Mischief]])

One of the twins has scars on his face and body from his transformation, and [[World Underneath - Mischief]] is careful to not say which twin. However, given the dialogue and thematic choices, it's most likely Kieran that's the one with the scars.

[[World Underneath - Mischief]] provides additional context on their backstory:
* They grew up on the streets, then were kidnapped by [[Ever]]
* There, twin experiments gave them mind link powers. They can see what the other sees, and also feel the pain the other feels.
* There was an "incompatability" reaction, causing them to be at risk of "transforming" ( #todo connect this to the Ever black crystal stuff)
* They escape, and decide to go out with a bang, trying to kill [[Sylus]]
* He ends up taking them in, and helping keep the transformation at bay
