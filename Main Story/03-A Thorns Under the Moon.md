[[Zayne]]'s branch in [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] to locate a [[Spatium Core]] fragment.

# Summary
A [[Wanderer]] with a [[Beta-Protocurve]] has been attacking people at [[Chansia Hospital]], causing people with [[Protocore Syndrome]] to go into coma or shock. [[Zayne]] and [[Greyson]] are sent over as assisting doctors, and [[MC]] joins as their hunter escort.

Once at the hospital, one patient is revealed to be different. He has unusual [[Metaflux]] readings and scale-like growths in his heart that resemble the [[Wanderer crystal sample]] [[MC]] got from the [[N109 Zone]]. During the surgery, a [[Wanderer]] almost appears. The patient recovers abnormally quickly, claiming to have been trapped in a nightmare. Suddenly, the [[Wanderer]] shows itself and pulls [[Zayne]] and [[MC]] into a [[Protofield]] based on Zayne's nightmares.

Zayne appears as [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]], and together they fight their way through the "dream". Once they escape and kill the [[Wanderer]], they gain an [[Aether Core]] fragment, later revealed to be part of the [[Spatium Core]]. They also find a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that had summoned the monsters to [[Chansia Hospital]] and was made by [[Ever]].

## Commentary

### Dream Layers

The dream has two layers: The first is [[Akso Hospital]] and the corridor where [[Zayne]] dreams of [[MC]] dying to [[black ice]] while he's unable to stop it.

The second is the location of the [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] timeline, albeit even more dilapidated.

Some key elements of the dream are given out of chronological order--specifically, the beginning and end of the Akso Hospital layer's nightmare are flipped.

As presented:
* MC sees [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] about to stab her with [[black ice]] to the heart.
* She falls further into Layer 2, where [[Zayne]] wears the same outfit but is otherwise the Dr. Zayne she knows.
* They go out to destroy the Protocore Clusters, and as Zayne goes to cut down the last shadow, it suddenly becomes [[MC]]. She says "You're not Zayne", then begs Zayne to kill her (i.e. begs [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] to kill her). [[black ice]] blooms from her chest in a [[black crystal flower]].
* At the very end of this layer, Zayne is encased and stabbed through the chest with [[black crystals]] as occurs in his punishment from [[Astra]] in [[Tower of Secrets]].
* MC finds herself in [[Akso Hospital]]'s garden, then walks through a misty hall and ends up in the living room of Dr. Zayne's house. He's there, with black ice spreading down his arm and up his neck, like when he loses control of his Evol.
* She resonates to melt the ice.
* While doing this, she has a flashback to when she first entered the Protofield in the Akso Hospital garden:
	* The [[Wanderer]] had injured her, then [[Zayne]] carried her to a hospital bed and used his Evol ([[white ice]]) to heal her. This removed a black impurity that stained her right hand, and it moved to his instead, turning to white ice.
* Back in the living room, he explains that protecting her was protecting himself, because she's his "hunter escort" and he had to be sure she'd be safe.
* Together, they strike out to go destroy the Protofield with their [[resonance]].

In chronological order:
* MC lands in the [[Akso Hospital]] Garden in Layer 1, clutching her chest and injured by the [[Wanderer]]. Zayne takes her to the hospital bed to heal her, glad he has the choice to take on the black impurity for her.
* When she wakes up, they're in the second layer of Dawnbreaker's timeline. They fight their way out. Zayne's power shows the black impurity, at first having a protective layer of [[white ice]] and eventually turns to entirely [[black ice]].
* As they return to the Akso Hospital layer, Zayne's Evol is out of control, likely due to the impurity he absorbed from her.
* How this layer of the nightmare "should" end is that Zayne's out-of-control Evol turns to black ice and kills her.
* Instead, she's able to melt it with her [[resonance]] (having her flashback) and then they go out to defeat the Wanderer and escape the Protofield.

There's a cyclical element here, where you can interpret the black impurity that Zayne heals from MC as having been originally put there by the attack from Dawnbreaker/himself.

By reversing the order of the nightmare, a new ending is possible. It also reflects the fragmented nature of dreams.

By the end of the story branch, [[Zayne]]'s nightmares will be back:
> Black crystals emerge from his palm. They encroach on the girls' forearm. Sunlight is engulfed by darkness once more.
