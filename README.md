# LaDS-Lore-Project
 A deep dive into Love and Deepspace lore and plot.

**THIS PROJECT CONTAINS MANY SPOILERS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY TAGGED.**

If you browse this project, you WILL see spoilers, many of which are major! It's recommended to not browse this project until you've played through the game content at least once.

# Summary
This project is a personal labor of love to map the lore and plot of the Love and Deepspace game for an EN audience. I've been finding it really satisfying to map different themes and concepts across the many different types of content in the game. Since everything comes out in bits and pieces, you get much more of the full picture when you connect it all together.

Another big plus of creating a project like this is that it's search-able and link-able in a way that reading in-game is not. It's also a helpful jumping off point for remembering where a certain tidbit of lore was mentioned, so you can go back for further detail.

I know this project won't be the most accessible to fans that aren't techy, but it's the best tool for my goals and I hope others will at least be able to glean a little bit if they're interested!

## Fair Use Disclosure
Love and Deepspace is owned by Infold. Text that is taken directly from the game is clearly denoted either by the use of quotations, or by the **Spacepedia** header. Summaries are in my words, but refer to IP that is property of Infold.

Conjecture is also clearly noted, either by the use of a header (including the "Commentary" header) or double parentheses ((like this)). Anything labeled as conjecture are just my ideas, and are not confirmed game canon. If you do happen to reference or build on my conjecture, I'd love if you tag or credit me, but I'm also not gonna come after you or anything.

# About Me
I go by pinkest-nekomata and Bethany Baker. I'm an author of monster and paranormal romance, which you can find at my website, [bakecookieswritesmut.com](http://bakecookieswritesmut.com). I'm also chronically ill and disabled, so when I don't have the energy to work on my own projects, I love diving into others' worlds as well. :)

To that end, you can read all my LaDS Fanfic [on AO3 here](https://archiveofourown.org/users/pinkest_nekomata/works?fandom_id=105143371). I'm also fairly active on Tumblr, where my LaDS-specific blog is [linkons-most-wanted](https://www.tumblr.com/linkons-most-wanted) and my general blog is [pinkest-nekomata](https://www.tumblr.com/pinkest-nekomata).

If you're more interested in my original works, you can [subscribe to my newsletter](https://bakecookieswritesmut.com/subscribe/) or follow me on Instagram/Threads @bakecookieswritesmut

And though I'm not as active there, I'm also on BlueSky [@pinkest-nekomata.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/pinkest-nekomata.bsky.social)
# FAQ

## How do I view the project?
This project was created with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). You can download or clone this repo and open it as an Obsidian Vault in order to use Obsidian's mapping and linking features.

You can also just browse the files via GitHub! Most of the formatting will work, but the links between documents will appear with brackets. Those will become active links when opened in Obsidian.

For more help, you can refer to the [Obsidian documentation on managing vaults](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Manage+vaults).

## Where do I start?
If you have general questions about the project, this page has those answers.

## Can I add this content to a wiki?
 Yes, please do! Because I wanted to keep this lightweight/easy for me and focus on what I'm most interested in, it didn't make sense for me to contribute directly to a formal wiki. But I hope other fans can benefit from it!
 
 Please feel free to use any of the transcriptions or summaries here or refer to them for other fanworks, assuming you're complying with all relevant licenses and policies.

## How accurate is this information?
The information herein is accurate to the best of my abilities, but there are likely mistakes, including transcription errors. I may also be repeating grammar irregularities or ambiguous phrasing that are present in the game's EN localization, so be mindful of this as well. I've corrected some obvious typos in the source material, but probably also introduced some of my own.

Anything that's my conjecture should be clearly labeled either with a header (such as the "Commentary" header) or with double parentheses ((like this)). I have also done my best to differentiate between what is stated vs. implied in the game, and to provide citations so you can reference the primary material yourself if you choose. 
## How did you decide what to include?
Since this is a lore project, I've focused on things that are most relevant to the game's lore. Given how character-driven the story is, this does mean including a lot of references to character traits and motivations. However, I don't intend to go fully into the romances with each LI, rather focusing on the events that impact the main story and the interpretation of its events. (Myths are of particular interest, here.)

For important passages that may contain subtleties, I've erred on the side of including full transcriptions. I've also transcribed some lines that I just think are interesting/compelling/clever, or that I know I'll want to reference verbatim later.

Many of these decisions are subjective, and I'm mostly following my gut as a storyteller and what I personally find most interesting. If I've excluded a passage that you think is important, please don't take it personally! I may have just missed something, or interpreted something in a different way.

## Will this project be maintained?
Maybe! No guarantees. If you find the project in an abandoned state and want to add to it, please feel free to fork and create your own version!

## If I see errors, should I contact you about them?
Maybe! If I'm actively working on the project, I'm definitely open to feedback. However, I am one (disabled) person, so I'm not sure how much time I'll have to maintain/expand this project in the future, so I wouldn't want you to waste your effort. You're welcome to send a message, but I may not see or respond to it for a while (if ever).

On a related note, please don't expect the formatting or layout of these pages to be perfectly consistent. (I know it's kinda random when I do/don't use the document links for commonly appearing concepts. I'm typing all this by hand.) They're meant to serve as useful reference sheets, not as a polished product. I am unlikely to do much perfecting of the format unless it's getting in the way of usability.

## What if I want to contribute to this project?
On a case by case basis, I may have the bandwidth to collaborate. More likely, though, I'll be doing this on my own rhythm. Please feel free to fork the project, which will allow you to add your own content and pull in any updates I end up adding at your leisure.

## What version of the game are you working from?
I'm working from the English (EN) localization and voice-over, plus some translation notes here and there as I see them. I'll cite those notes when I'm able. I have a decent amount of exposure to/understanding of localization and related challenges, but sadly do not have any competence in Chinese (traditional or simplified), Japanese, or Korean directly.

## What's this about translation notes that can't be cited?
