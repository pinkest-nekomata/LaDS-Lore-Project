aka Tarus City, "city of ebony"



A location in [[Beyond Cloudfall]].

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 3]]
> An endless crimson mountain range, covered with forests that are void of life with their scorched trees, surrounds the lonely city. There is no other path.

> That lace is chaotic and evil, a home for those who are shunned by others. It's a world different from what I know.

> The nights in Tarus City are always brightly lit. Unlike the flames of war in the Ivory City, desires and revelry burn.

From [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 4]]
> Tarus City sits near the foot of the dragon's lair. The origin of its name is lost to time, but it's said to be connected to the Abyss.
* ((It's are reference to [Tartarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus), "the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans." The space-time prison and Sylus's Tomorrow's Catch 22 AU also reference Tartarus.))
