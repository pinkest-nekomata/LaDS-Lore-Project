**Description**
> Sylus is injured. This might be a good chance to discover his vulnerabilities.
## Key Info
* [[Sylus - Abysm Sovereign]] can sustain injuries--but primarily caused by his own power
	* "To satisfy a desire insatiable, I'm braying on the brink of devouring this body. Enduring this searing pain is the price of wielding incomparable power."
* [[Sorceress MC]] attempts to shackle him to something, and he plays along briefly, just like in [[Midnight Stealth]]

# Trivia
* Sylus describes [[Sorceress MC]]'s scent as "steamy and sweet, like cherry wine"
* She bites his Adam's apple
* He calls her "sweetie"
