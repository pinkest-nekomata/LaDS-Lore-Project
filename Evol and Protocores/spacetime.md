A recurring theme.

Note the name of the first chapter, [[01-01.00 Singularity Echo]]
* [Gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), in general relativity, a point in which gravity is so intense that spacetime itself becomes ill-defined (see also, [[gravity]])
* The [[Deepspace Tunnel]] distorts spacetime and causes [[converging timelines]]
* The narration mentions a time loop
* So, "Singularity Echo" could refer to the looping and repeating past this "Singularity", i.e. the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] and its consequences
