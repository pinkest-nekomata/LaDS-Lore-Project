**Description**
> While undertaking a mission in the suburbs, l was caught off guard by an abrupt downpour.
> With no alternative for seeking refuge, my only option was...

# Summary
Drenched in a downpour while on a mission in the suburbs, MC remembers Sylus mentioned a place he had. She waits under the porch, but he's coincidentally there to feed a cat. MC goes and takes a hot shower (Sylus leaves her clothes to change into) and then she goes down to the basement and finds him trying to coax out a kitten. 

It scratches them as it flees, leading MC to "decorate" sylus with colorful bandages and they have a conversation about [[Sylus's smile]] and his approachability. MC leaves, and Sylus follows with an umbrella, claiming he just happens to also be going that way.

# Key Info
* Sylus has a villa in the [[Linkon]] suburbs, street number 358
	* [[Villa 358]], see also [[Sylus's nests]]
	* He had mentioned this to MC previously
	* It has a gate, a garden, and a porch
	* Sylus feeds the cats there
		* The one that lives outside had a litter of kittens, but only one survived, and it's now two months old
* Sylus doesn't use his Evol to move the kitten so he can avoid hurting it.

# Trivia
* Apparently the CN confirms that MC does accidentally play a mating call ([[lost tr source]])

> MC: This is to remind you of a genuine smile's curve, so you don't--
> *Sylus grabs my wrist.*
