# Key Info
* Xavier is being cagey about playing the piano
* [[MC]] and [[Xavier]] investigate increased Wanderer activity in [[No-Hunt Zone 19]], teleporting to the signal tower there (meaning Xavier's been there before)
* Xavier's been sneaking off, and MC at first assumes he's been at the no-hunt zone, but then catches him returning with sheet music.
* He invites her to a private concert at [[This Shore]], playing Silvery Polyphony. He implies that it's an echo from the cosmos (ie decoded from the signal tower), only for [[MC]]'s ears. Later, he implies that he decoded the signal long ago (during his previous time on earth) and has been waiting to share it with MC.
* Afterward, he teleports them back to the signal tower, and they have a heartfelt conversation.

# Trivia
* Xavier frequently plays with and gives treats to a kitten that lives outside their apartment building.
