# Details
When [[MC]] and [[Jenna]] are alone, the Captain transfers a "[[Ever Secret Investigation Report]]" to her. There's a mention of the [[Bloomshore District explosion]]. Jenna recommends she read it at hime.

As MC leaves for the day, rain is in the forecast. The sky is foreboding.

> As I am about to move, a sound presses against my heart like a string, sending a shiver down my spine.

This arc's [[cosmic cinematic#End of Prologue to Tomorrow]] begins:

Storm clouds rage and the sky dims. [[The giant red eye]] looks down from above--this time, it resembles both a nebula and a mechanical lense. Wind swirls, and buildings seem to disintegrate around it. The following text appears:
> Again...?!
> My heart responds to that eye...
> The world around me fades
> But the call I hear becomes clearer
> It's behind that
> Soemwhere in the distance...
> Lies the power of [[Aether Core]]
