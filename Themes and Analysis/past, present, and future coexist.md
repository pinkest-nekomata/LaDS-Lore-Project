This is a recurring theme in the game's lore. Thematically, it's provided as an explanation for the game's [[branching timelines]], [[converging timelines]], and the way that [[MC]]'s memories from other lives return to her. It connects to the idea of [[love and eternity]]. This concept blends the philosophical and the sci-fi, adding depth to the story's setting and lore.

From [[End of Deepspace]]:
> A: The concept of "the past, present, and future" is deeply rooted in our perception of time. But does time really exist? Understandably, what we perceive as the future has already transpired on a universal scale. In any case, as ordinary individuals, we are bound by a unidirectional experience of time. Since we cannot access our "future consciousness," we are still unaware of what lies ahead.Â 

From [[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]]
> Some say that from a higher dimensional perspective, time doesn't exist. The past, present, and future all unfold in the same space. A person can only see the world before them because their eyes can only perceive the light projected from it. 
> If this is true, then somewhere in the vast cosmos, there might exist a point where light from countless timelines converges. From there, one could see every star that ever existed, from the explosion of the universe to its eventual collapse, and witness every possible ending the world could take under an infinite number of choices.
