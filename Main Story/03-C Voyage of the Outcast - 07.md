# Summary
A conversation with the student reveals that he's still having memory problems. As [[Xavier]] starts to realize what's actually going on, he figures out that [[Soren]] has headed to the research lab. ((Specifically, he's pieced together that [[Soren]] can teleport, and that's why they haven't seen him leave.)) 

Xavier teleports him and MC there, and they find [[Soren]] at the [[RMFMA]]. Speaking in vague terms, it's revealed that they already know each other, and Soren says it's too late to stop him. With the [[RMFMA]], he summons a [[Wanderer]].

[[Soren]] then teleports away, tipping [[MC]] off to his potential identity. The [[Wanderer]] attacks, but doesn't summon a normal [[Protofield]], and then MC is cast into darkness.

## Commentary
[[Soren]] also recognizes [[MC]] here--he would have known her as [[Queen MC]] since he's one of the [[Backtrackers]], which is why he says [[Xavier]] can't boss him around anymore.

[[WU-04 From The Stars]] and [[Passing By]] reference [[Backtrackers]] who've turned traitor over the years.

# Details
The student is cheery again, but when they ask about him saying he'd take time off, he says he doesn't remember saying that--but that his friends say his memory's been bad since the attack.

[[Xavier]] asks directly about the study event two weeks ago. At first, he doesn't seem to remember the event at all--but then says they found something "intriguing". He remembers the [[RMFMA]], but says being near it was like being in a haunted house--literally, the specific one he's always been terrified of. The other students reported briefly feeling like they were in a scary place.

Xavier reveals that these "hallucinations" are actually something the [[RMFMA]] can cause.
> Xavier: To make a long story short, it's like recreating a plane of existence and overlapping it with our reality. But only a few people know about this... We surely underestimated Soren.

Guessing at what's really happening, [[Xavier]] grabs MC and teleports them to the research center just as night falls. They find [[Soren]] there, using the [[RMFMA]].
> Soren: You're quicker than I thought.
> Xavier: I should've known the moment I saw you.
> *Xavier stops behind him. After a brief pause of tension, Soren turns around.*
> Soren: Do you think you can still order me around, Xavier?
> *He has a glance at me. Then, he looks away.*
> Soren: You can't, and neither can she.
> *A sudden gust of wind stirs the indoor air. My heart trembles as I sense a faint energy [[fluctuation]].*
> MC: Xavier, something's here!

MC and Xavier draw their weapons, and MC gives the order to take down Soren before the Wanderer arrives--but then he disappears, and she hears his voice behind her.
> Soren: It's too late. It'll take you to the place you've always wanted to visit.
> MC: (He can also teleport. Could he be...?!)

Unusually violent [[fluctuation]]s occur, and they realize the [[Wanderer]] that's appeared has an [[Aether Core]]. Xavier draws it out with his lightblade.
> The expected [[Protofield]] doesn't materialize. Instead, I feel a sudden coolness on my face as if I'm being pushed through a barrier. Out of the corner of my eye, the [[RMFMA]] lights up again.
> Before everything goes completely dark, I reach out for Xavier's hand--
> And I grab nothing.
