*Adds [[Caleb]] as a Love Interest*
# Summary
Unofficially investigating the [[Cascade District explosion]], MC takes leave and heads to [[Skyhaven]] to go undercover as a [[Farspace Fleet]] officer. Young girl [[Mia]] is in the hospital and her twin brother [[Kevi]] is missing, as are [[Kevi and Mia's parents]]. [[MC]] is shocked to find that [[Caleb]] is still alive, and with his help plus [[Zayne]]'s (who's there by coincidence) MC is able to talk to Mia and obtain [[Lucia]], Mia's toy.

MC returns to the site of the explosion where [[Lucia]] helps her coax [[Kevi]] out, and he shares that his parents gave him a fragment of the [[Spatium Core]] to help keep him and Mia safe. They told him to never trust the [[Farspace Fleet]]. MC assures Kevi she'll be back ASAP and urges him to hide again, then comes up with a plan with [[Zayne]] to get him into [[Hunters Association]] custody.

This plan is foiled when [[Caleb]] uses [[MC]]'s cold symptoms as an excuse to dose her with "cold medicine", keeping her asleep so she can't leave. MC wakes the next morning to find that [[Mia]] is dead. At the funeral, [[Kevi]] is behaving strangely and seems friendly towards the [[Farspace Fleet]] who "rescued" him. MC gets a tip from [[Viper]] which leads her to [[Lucius's Villa]] and the knowledge that [[Kevi]] has been modified with a chip, later revealed to be the [[Toring chip]]. She also overhears [[Professor Lucius]] and [[Caleb]] collaborating, talking about "cleanup" and "salvage".

MC modifies [[Caleb's necklace]] with a Hunter-issue [[stealth monitoring chip]], then gives it back to him at the supernova of [[Klc9831007]], which they'd made plans to watch together as kids. That night, she follows him to the [[Final Clean-Up]], where it's revealed that the [[Farspace Fleet]] is taking out [[human-like Wanderer]]s who are failed experiment subjects. [[Professor Lucius]] is implicated. MC is injured, and when Caleb takes her aboard the fleet ship, it soon becomes clear he has no intention of letting her go. MC attempts to escape and learns the name of the [[Toring chip]] from a [[Cybezin]] product label, but Caleb catches her and returns her to [[Caleb's place]].

Here, tensions escalate. Caleb keeps her detained for three days, promising she'll be safe enough at the end of that period. Three days pass, and Caleb finally lets slip some of his repressed feelings. The curfew is lifted and MC is free to leave. She says goodbye to Caleb at the runway as he heads off for his mission. On her way home, she finds a "forgiveness coupon" in her pocket that she gave to Caleb when they were kids. She doesn't know what's real or fake with him, but she doesn't want to lose him again.

 Then, in an omniscient POV, we learn that [[Professor Lucius]] is working on [[The Fountain of Atei]] and is actively looking for MC so he can use her power. Caleb attempts to throw him off MC's scent. ((There's a big lore dump here, so it's recommended to review [[04-02.10 Crossroads]] directly.))
