When [[Dimitri]] first meets MC he introduces himself as the "ferryman on the River Styx"--that is, Charon. This foreshadows that he owns the trading hub/district [[Charon]] and that he's behind the [[Zoion Hunt]]. He's essentially guiding people "from life into death" by running such a deadly game.
