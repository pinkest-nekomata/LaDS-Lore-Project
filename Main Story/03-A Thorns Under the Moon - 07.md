# Summary
MC falls through Zayne's nightmare of her being impaled by black crystals, except she's in her own view getting impaled. Then she tumbles into the fog, and eventually arrives alongside Zayne in the [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protofield]]. It's definitely been influenced by an [[Aether Core]].

She pieces together that they're inside a manifestation [[Zayne]]'s dream. ((Readers know about [[Zayne's Dawnbreaker dreams]], but MC doesn't yet.)) Zayne reveals she's been unconscious two days by his reckoning. They pause to eat chocolate together to ensure MC keeps up her strength. Zayne admits this place is the scene of his nightmares.

## Commentary
[[Still In Dark]] puts the setting here in context, and is very helpful to read/reread alongside this part of the story.

# Details
MC feels like she's falling through thick fog. Finally, her feet touch solid ground and the surroundings emerge. She's in a dim hospital corridor.
* ((This directly evokes the one from [[Zayne]]'s nightmare in [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon - 01]]))

MC senses an [[Aether Core]]'s fluctuation and concludes she's in the [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protofield]]. She turns towards footsteps and sees a dark figure.
> MC: Zayne?
> *An onslaught of sharp ice crystals materializes around me. They're ready to pierce my heart--*
> MC: ...!
> *The ground beneath me disappears, and I find myself falling into a sense of weightlessness again. As I float in this void, blurred lights and sounds rush past me like an avalanche.
> Within the boundless darkness, it's as if a pair of hands is gently lifting my tired soul.
> I struggle to open my eyes. After feeling my steady heartbeat for several seconds, I sit up on the bed.*
> `Zayne, wearing the outfit of Dawnbreaker, sighs with relief.`
> Zayne: You're awake.
> *By the floor-to-ceiling window stands a figure wearing black clothing. He turns around. Behind him are dilapidated buildings and the sunset's tender light.*
> MC: Zayne...
> *The figure takes another step, his appearance nearly overlapping with the dark figure I had seen before. I move back.*
> Zayne: ... How are you feeling?
> *After hesitating for a moment, I reach out and touch his cheek. I trace his eeybrows and the contours of his face. I recognize the features I know so well. In this silence, he remains motionless. He just looks at me.*
> MC: I'm fine. I think I just had a dream.
> *Perhaps it's the influence of the [[Protofield]] that caused me to have those strange illusions... Shaking my head to clear my thoughts, I shift my focus to the room. The cracked, grayish-white walls enclose a space where a sofa, holographic screen, refrigerator, and various functional home appliances exist in close proximity. It looks like the "Home" of someone who struggles living a normal life.*
* ((This is [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]]'s apartment, also seen in [[Still In Dark]].))

Zayne asks if she remembers what happened in the ward, and she realizes they're still in the [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protofield]]. Zayne confirms. Outside the window, the city is a desolate skeleton.

MC shares her conclusion that the [[Protofield]] shows an [[Aether Core]]'s influence, then briefly says something about the dream of the icicles and shivers. Zayne gives her a blanket, assuring her it was just a dream.

The fridge contains the nutrition drinks and jar of chocolate that compose [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]]'s diet. Zayne offers a chocolate and reveals MC has been unconscious for two days in Zayne's perception. He urges her to eat or dink. On the sill, the bright green of a [[jasmine]] stands out. But the stem has already begun to wither.

MC correctly guesses this wouldn't be in a normal Protofield, and concludes that the Protofield is a manifestation of someone's dream, especially based on what the patient said. And it's all unfamiliar to her, so she concludes it's Zayne's dream.

> Zayne: `(Inhales)` Are there any comments you'd like to make about it?
> MC: Even in a world as broken as this, chocolate still exists. I expected nothing less from you.
> Zayne: Shouldn't you be saying something like, 'Thank goodness it's Zayne's dream, we can still eat chocolate.'

MC notices that Zayne looks slightly strange, especially with the dark clothes, and guesses it's how Zayne sees himself in his dreams. That's half true--it's [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]]. However, this time, Dr. Zayne remains in control of himself, despite the appearance change.

He admits to dreaming of this place. But in his dreams, the [[jasmine]] hasn't wilted and the world outside isn't so dilapidated. (([[Zayne's Dawnbreaker dreams]]))

MC correctly guesses these are the nightmares that have been bothering him. He quietly confirms. She assures him dreams are the opposite of reality, and offers him a chocolate. He eats it from her fingers. She jokes that the chocolate might not be chocolate flavored, and he jokes it's carrot flavored.

Outside, a bird flies.

> Zayne: Since dreams are the opposite of reality, perhaps I'm not a doctor in this one.
