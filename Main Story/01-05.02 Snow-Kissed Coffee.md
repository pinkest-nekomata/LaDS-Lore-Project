# Summary

The [[Boreas Express]] train from the [[Arctic hub station]] to [[Snowcrest]] is cancelled, but [[MC]] quickly runs into [[Zayne]] in the station. He'd anticipated her refusal to wait to see [[Dr. Noah]], and came up with his own excuse to head over and find her along the way.

# Details

The next day, MC has already scheduled an appointment with [[Dr. Noah]]. She arrives in the [[Arctic]], where [[Tara]] calls to check on her. MC lies that she's in [[Snowcrest]] just for vacation, and Tara comments on MC being a workaholic recently.

Unfortunately, the next train to [[Snowcrest]] (the [[Boreas Express]]) has been cancelled. As MC is asking staff about another option, she overhears [[Zayne]] ordering a cheesecake and a croissant at a nearby cafe.

She greets him, noting that he doesn't seem surprised to see her. She quickly regrets doing so as she's getting caught not telling Zayne she was going to the arctic already. Zayne claims that a week prior, Dr. Noah had asked Zayne to come out and assist him with some things.

When Zayne's order of two lattes arrives, which he'd already ordered before seeing MC, his own plan is revealed--he'd guessed that MC wouldn't wait and decided to head to the arctic "with" her.

Zayne: "Did I say we met by chance?"
