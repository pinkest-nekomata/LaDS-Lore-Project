This is a meta-commentary on the localization of words referring to celestial bodies in the EN localization of the game. It can be quite confusing until you realize that in the original CN, the same word can be translated as either "star" or "planet", and likewise, the word for "galaxy" is the same as for "star system".

In EN, especially through a sci-fi genre lens, that distinction is *extremely* consequential. To make matters more confusing, different parts of the game referring to the same object choose different translations.

This page collects the broader context on the root words (to the best of my ability) so that it can be referenced anywhere there's potential confusion.

# CN Terms
恒星系 (hengxing xi) = galaxy, star system 
* i.e. "a collection of celestial bodies"
星 (xing) = star, planet, celestial body, particles 
* i.e. "a celestial body"/"one of those glowy things in the sky"

So, translations are context-dependent. The etymology of "planet" in EN is actually "moving star", so CN sticks more to the original nomenclature.
