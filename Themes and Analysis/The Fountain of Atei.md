# Name
The name evokes the [Fountain of Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth), hinting at a goal of immortality, which we know is part of the [[X-Heart]] project that also involves exposing human hearts to [[Protocore]]s, and which [[Ever]] announced in the [[Public Account]] post [[Immortality No Longer a Dream!]] . We also know this goal of immortality was/will be achieved (at least in the version of the timeline [[Xavier]] is from, see also [[branching timelines]]) at the cost of feeding humans into the core of [[Philos]], giving rise to new [[Wanderer]]s. ([[Shooting Stars]])

# Consciousness
The game includes the concept of [[consciousness energy]] which exists and persists in the universe, and may come up later with the angle of implanting human consciousness into [[Wanderer]]s.
