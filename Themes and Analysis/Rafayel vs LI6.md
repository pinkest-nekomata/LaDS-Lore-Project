Since the sixth love interest hasn't been released at, we can only guess at which traits the new LI will share vs. subvert when compared to Rafayel. The information below is merely speculation and conjecture.

See also: [[!LI Foils Index]]
# Shared traits
* Bond of submission/service? ie genie/pet theming?
	* Given that other characters already have more "dominant" theming, I think it's more likely that the submission theme is a similarity between the two vs. something subverted by the foil
* Immortal originally from Earth?
	* Rafayel pulls from "fairy tales" like sirens/mermaids and genies. The sinister nature of Raf's siren powers makes it less likely that the 6th LI would feature "evil" folklore, but it might
* Colorful/flamboyant hair and theming?
* A creative type?
	* Alternatively, the foil could be a destructive type to fully contrast Rafayel, especially since Rafayel is already a musician and a singer.
* Dramatic?
