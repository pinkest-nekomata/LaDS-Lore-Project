# Summary
The [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] is declared a success and [[revenant]]s scramble to collect trinkets and totems of the [[Chosen One]]. [[Chosen One MC]] reflects that because she's an "outsider" to [[Sindersfell]], she'll eventually lose her memories and become like the [[revenant]]s unless she can get back to [[Philos]]. So, she decides to see where the Pilgrimage path leads.

It's revealed that MC convinced the ferryman to lend her his boat, the only one that doesn't sink on the [[Sinders]], by helping him out and gradually befriending him. Xavier's reaction hints that he and the ferryman knew each other from [[Philos]]. Nearby, [[revenant]] knights fight in a burning forest and other signs of the Apocalypse appear.

Past an eerie, dense fog, the river widens and thrashes. Ghost-like beings call out in despair and rock the boat from beneath, trying to get at them. Pain seizes her chest, and golden light seems to flow down into the water, with the sensation of being drained. A whirlpool forms beneath them.

When MC regains awareness, she's wrapped in a warm embrace and the boat glides supernaturally underwater, following the riverbed. This seems to be the true path of the [[Great Pilgrimage]]. They pass motes of energy that MC says feel familiar to her power, and she wonders if this is the legendary cave at the center of the planet that connects [[Philos]] and [[Sindersfell]].

In the caves, they find a [[Wanderer]] skeleton. Speaking of the human skeletons that seem frozen fighting it, Xavier cryptically says, "They were devoured by those monsters before they could escape." MC suspects he knows more than he admits, then they speak of what might happen if she finds [[Philos]]. [[Xavier]] references [[Xavier and MC's little planet]] again.

They finally find the [[Tree of Life]], but find that it's made of corpses. Xavier talks about how [[Philos]] is an artificial planet depending on [[Protocore]]s, and humans were sacrificed to it by the royal family, covered up with the "pilgrimage". The [[revenant]]s from before ended up here, and speak of how the [[Sinders]] grows without end and seeks [[Chosen One MC]]'s power. A distraught [[revenant]] accuses MC of abandoning them and turns into a [[Wanderer]], and [[Xavier]] cuts him down.

They head back towards the castle. He gifts her a [[Protocore]] fragment from [[Philos]] which she calls a "shiny pebble." She decides to touch his reflection in the river again to try to remember more. [[Xavier]] places [[forget-me-nots]] on MC's tombstone. Upon seeing her name on the tombstone, she remembers that she was the forgotten queen all along.

## Commentary

# Details

When it's revealed that Xavier doesn't remember the main exchange in [[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 6]], he references her memory loss too:
> MC: These eyes were blessed by the Chosen One's presence.
> Xavier: Should I pluck out my eyelashes for you to count too?
> MC: These lips have also kissed... Ahem.
> Remembering what happened that day, I swallow my words.
> Xavier: You don't want to continue?
> MC: You actually don't remember anything.
> *He responds with an expressionless look. Then he turns away, and his voice is unexpectedly tinged with a hint of resentment.*
> Xavier: You're the one who doesn't remember anything.

The ghost-like beings draining MC's strength are described as such:
> River's Shadow: I don't want this... I don't want to be trapped here! Join me... Become part of these dead waters!
> MC: These voices... Where are they coming from?
> Xavier: Wait. Don't fall in.
> *Under the water's surface, countless invisible hands seem to reach up. Hatred pushes them to maliciously toss our boat back and forth.*
> *I grip the edge of the boat with all the strength I can muster. Pain pulsates through my chest without warning.*
> *My vision blurs. It's as though invisible hands are squeezing my heart.*
> *The inky black water transforms into countless golden veins. I could almost believe streams of energy were flowing downward.*
> MC: (I feel awful... It's like my strength is being drained away...)
> Xavier: Watch out!
> *The increasingly violent currents strike our boat. The river's surface discards its serenity and transforms into a massive whirlpool.*
> *At that moment, l'm like a seed. I'm plunged into a darkness unknown to all.*

When exploring the underwater "passages":
> MC: The archives at the [[Order of Babel]]'s monastery had records of a certain Philosian legend. It spoke of a mysterious cave that was connected to the center of the planet. Could this be the cave that connects [[Philos]] and [[Sindersfell]]? 

Upon discovering the [[Tree of Life]], a clear explanation of how this continuity's [[Philos]] maintained itself:
> There's a deathly pale wrist encased in crystals.
> Akin to veins, dark red vines are wrapped around a rib cage. The delicate roots of eerie flowers penetrate hollow eye sockets.
> MC: That's...
> Xavier: ...Look over there.
> *In the distance, a twisted "tree" looms.*
> *It isn't a real tree, but one formed by countless crystallized skeletons. They're stacked and entangled with one another.*
> *Their twisted forms are similar, for they step on those beneath them in a futile attempt to reach for something on high.*
> *Thin vines ensnare the crystallized remains. Together, they form a thick, trunk-like structure that's deeply embedded in the planet.*
> MC: That's...
> *A thousand horrified thoughts flood my mind.*
> *This is the Tree of Life... It's a tree made from corpses.*
> I've never seen these people before, yet I recognize their clothing as garments that belong to [[Philos]].
> Each and every one of their expressions are filled with despair and terror. They're like souls in the depths of hell who are seeking salvation.
> MC: Were these Philosians trapped here? Why...
> Xavier: [[Philos]] is an artificial planet.
> *He suddenly speaks.*
> Xavier: Their pretense of eternity depends on an energy source called a "Protocore."
> MC: ..Protocore?
> *Familiarity washes over me again, and for some reason, a sadness surfaces.*
> Xavier: The planet found itself on the verge of collapse after its energy was depleted. However, the most scholarly elder in the royal capital had a solution. The royal family discovered an uninhabited area with a chaotic [[Protofield]] in [[Starfall Forest]]. It was located in the southern region of the planet. Deep within that forest is a cave. It leads directly to the Heart of the planet. So long as humans were thrown into that cave, the planet's energy would never be depleted. Like the people who thought this system was justified, the planet possessed an insatiable greed.
> *He looks at those crystals that can no longer be called "human."*
> Xavier: They're the victims who were used as fuel.
> MC: Did anyone escape and live to tell the tale?
> *I look at Xavier, but I already know the answer in my heart.*
> Xavier:  ...No.
> *He starts walking again, moving past the tree as he continues forward.*
> Xavier: Those who defied orders and went to investigate disappeared after entering the cave.
> MC: The number of sacrifices required inevitably increased. No one would willingly sacrifice themselves for the planet unless there was a good reason.
> Xavier: Thus, the royal family came up with a plan to cover up their crimes. They no longer kept the sacrifice a secret. They used honor to disguise it and called it a "Pilgrimage." To maintain a false eternity, they needed to weave lies one after another. Every member of the royal family had to bear the burden of perpetuating these lies.
> MC: ...You were the one who ended it?
> *He shakes his head.*
> Xavier: Ironically, the one who did that wasn't even remembered.
> Although our surroundings are quiet, I can almost hear everyone's desperate cries for help as they faced death.
> Xavier: Now you know the truth. Do you still consider [[Philos]] your homeland?

The descriptions of crystals seem to echo those of the [[black crystals]] and the [[Abomination]]s/[[human-like Wanderer]]s.

When MC sees the memory of Xavier in the river, and he places [[forget-me-nots]] on her tombstone, the engraving reads:
> "Bethany, the First Queen of Philos. Her name shines quietly like the stars. Everlasting, it shall never fade."
