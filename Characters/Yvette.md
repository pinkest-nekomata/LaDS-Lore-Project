A sci-fi author, former [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]] engineer, and [[Liam]]'s ex-wife. She occasionally does guest lectures at [[Skyhaven University]] and was featured in Vol 13 of [[Sketches]].

Has a home studio in [[Hillside Gardens]] in the [[Philee District]] of [[Linkon]] that smells of plum blossoms thanks to the plum tree in her courtyard.

Though a former resident of [[Whirlreef Island]], she didn't return to it when it became a part of [[Skyhaven]] because to her it wasn't the same place at all--the seasons, wildlife, and surroundings were totally different.
