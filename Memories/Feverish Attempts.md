**Description**
> Xavier has started his secret missions again recently. Worried about his safety, I'm determined to make him develop a habit of "checking in" with me. To my surprise, he seems to have his own interpretation of what that means.

# Summary
[[Xavier]] and [[Jeremiah]] head to a [[psychiatric hospital]] where [[Isaiah]] is being held. Xavier had previously spared him, and he's lost his memories and is now harmless. However, when [[MC]] shows up coincidentally due to a community outreach event with the [[Hunters Association]], [[Isaiah]] recognizes her and becomes enraged, telling her she doesn't below. [[Jeremiah]] deals with him, taking him away.

[[Xavier]] and [[MC]] head over to [[Philo]] to take care of it for the next few days while [[Jeremiah]] is busy. MC asks Xavier to check in with her more, and he tells her about every little thing she's doing. A brief kiss leaves him panting. 

After that, MC leaves for a 2 week isolated training intensive. When she returns, Xavier's left her a flood of messages and she affirms that she likes when he's "chatty". When he's not at his apartment, he calls and sounds unwell, asking her to pick him up. (MC later realizes he called b/c he wasn't sure he'd make it.) She recognizes the coordinates as somewhere they've been on a mission before.

Amidst [[Protofield]] disturbances and dense fog, MC finds an exhausted Xavier with his [[suppression collar]] showing. He dispatches the last of the threat, and they sit by a lake. (([[Skymirror Salt Flat]]?? Unclear.)) Xavier is feverish, asks MC to help him administer the [[philosian drug]], then MC takes him home and takes care of him. He's unusually needy and clingy.

When he's better the next morning, MC says she'd rather be the one who helps prevent bad things from happening vs. taking care of him after.

# Key Info
* This memory specifically takes place after [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]].
	* [[MC]] pushes further that she needs to know "everything" about who Xavier is.
* [[Isaiah]] lost his memories and has been at the [[psychiatric hospital]] for some time. [[Xavier]] had insisted on sparing his life.
	* [[Xavier]] is here to investigate something about him.
	* Jeremiah warns that he might resume his attempts at revenge if he gets his memories back then, and is wary of him rejoining with "those people from back then".
	* He recognizes MC and briefly regains his sense of self.
* [[Isaiah]] previously worked with [[Ever]], but defected with classified intel. [[Xavier]] claims that when he and [[Jeremiah]] found Isaiah, he was already insane. Now that [[Ever]] has located him, they're moving him to keep him safe from Ever's retaliation.
* When Xavier over-uses his Evol, the [[suppression collar]] triggers side effects, like a fever.
	* Xavier says the fever will go away if he sleeps enough.
* MC remembers him previously administering the injectable medicine (([[philosian drug]])) alone in the wreckage of the [[Traceback II]].

# Trivia
* Annually, the [[Hunters Association]] sends [[Deepspace Hunter]]s out to provide public lectures and inspect facilities for risks as a community outreach program.
	* This is what brings MC to the [[psychiatric hospital]]
	* Prior years have always been two hunters, but Xavier was MIA this time
* When picking up [[Isaiah]], Xavier and Jeremiah give the fake names Mr. Xavon and Mr. Jeremy, respectively.
* The [[Hunters Association]] sometimes runs training intensives where [[Deepspace Hunter]]s are isolated from the outside world. This one lasts two weeks.

# Quotes

> [[Jeremiah]]: ...Don't tell me you're still hung up on that old oath to bring everyone home. You're insane!
> [[Xavier]]: You're overthinking it. There's something about him I need to investigate.
> Jeremiah: Never mind... I give up. Do whatever you want.

`Deflecting MC's question about Isiah:`
> Xavier: He used to be a stand-up comedian. But he never recovered mentally after his career crashed.
> Jeremiah: Exactly. Fate envied his talent! Just look at him. He's funny even when he's standing still. He was born for comedy.

`Upon recognizing MC:`
> [[Isaiah]]: You don't know, huh? You don't belong here. You're just like us—
> Jeremiah: He needs to take his meds...!

> [[Xavier]]: [[Ever]] placed their bets on him, but he defected while holding onto classified intel. Now he's a thorn in their side. He vanished for a while, and we thought he was dead. By the time we found him, he... Already went insane. EVER caught wind of it. So, Jeremiah is moving him to a safe place. Just in case.

> MC: If you were in a dangerous place, why did you pretend nothing was wrong in your texts?
> Xavier: Because you'd be worried.
> *That straightforward answer leaves me speechless.*
> MC: Then why did you call me?
> Xavier: ...Because I wanted to hear your voice.
> *His answers are still vague. He pauses before poking a blade of grass coated in dew.*
> MC:  ...You always have your reasons. I'm used to you disappearing on me. I won't look for you next time you're gone for a few days.
> *The light in Xavier's eyes dims for a second before he lowers his gaze.*
> Xavier: I'm sorry.
> *...Another empty apology. Unsure if I'm angry or sad, I punch his shoulder.*
> MC: Stop saying that! You never change—
> *His fluffy head lolls onto me before I can finish. Pressed against my shoulder, his temple is damp with sweat.*
> Xavier: I couldn't keep my promise. It's my fault. But I didn't lie to you...

> *He's burning up. I remember how he had to administer this medicine alone before collapsing in that abandoned spaceship.*

> Xavier: If you leave and my fever comes back in the middle of the night... What if I die? Will anyone notice?
> *I let out a quiet sigh and let go of my frustration. With a slight smile, I meet his inquisitive gaze.*
> MC: Funny you should say that... I was planning to look after my fragile neighbor.
> *His long eyelashes flutter under the lamp's warm light. The seemingly gray shadows on his face gradually fade.*
> Xavier: I only have one bed, though.
> MC: Then you can take the bed. I'll sleep in the living room.
> Xavier: But—
> *Done with his flimsy excuses, I grab his shoulders and gently steer him to the bedroom.*
> MC: Quiet. Focus on resting.

> MC: Instead of being the person who takes you home after something happens... I'd rather be the one who prevents the unexpected from happening.
