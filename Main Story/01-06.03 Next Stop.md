# Summary
[[Xavier]] warns [[MC]] to be careful again, telling a ghost story about a train that leads to the abyss after midnight. It turns out to be a prescient warning when a [[Wanderer]] distorts the space around the train, causing it to return to the station it had just left behind.

# Details
A few minutes later, [[MC]] reflects that she hasn't seen [[Xavier]] in over a month. ((Notably, "last month" is when the mysterious person bought all the [[Protocore]]s off the [[Black Market]].))

Xavier asks why she's going home so late, and she confesses to losing track of time while thinking about everything.

MC jokes that she wonders what will happen next, and if some crisis will unfold, since that always seems to happen when she runs into [[Xavier]]. ((And of course it does again.))

Xavier warns her to be careful, telling another urban legend to "scare" her that turns out to be kind of true. An empty train after midnight will drag its riders into the abyss.

After they both brush it off, MC notices that the train's been taking longer to reach the next station than it should. The train pulls into [[West Garden Station]]--but that's where MC got on. Sensing something is off, she asks [[Xavier]] if they should leave, but he warns her to stay on the train. If she goes out into the station, she'll be stuck with no way out.

The lights flicker and MC's [[Hunter's Watch]] goes off, signaling a [[Wanderer]]. Xavier grabs her wrist and tells her to watch out.
