[[Rafayel]]'s branch in [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] to locate a [[Spatium Core]] fragment.

# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Rafayel]] go undercover at the wedding anniversary of [[Maxwell]], an alleged [[Protocore]] smuggler, on his private island [[Jewel Reef]]. Rafayel appears in his [[Rafayel - Phantom of the Siren]] outfit. However, the lead about an overpriced necklace turns out to be a red herring, and it was just a romantic gesture.

The real threat are two [[Ever]] representatives who threaten [[Maxwell]] and then head out to the island's [[blue hole]] to use a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] to summon a [[Wanderer]]. [[Rafayel]] and [[MC]] are there and defeat the [[Wanderer]] before [[Rafayel]] invites [[MC]] down to go "treasure hunting". Giving her a kiss so she can breathe underwater, he leads her into the deep where they find the [[Tome of the Sea God]].

[[MC]]'s blood is the key to awakening it, and she remembers her [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]]. Once back above the sea in an old boat, [[Rafayel]] is briefly possessed by the [[Sea God]]--a price for awakening the power. Rafayel reveals an [[Aether Core]] fragment ((soon to be revealed as part of the [[Spatium Core]])) he believed to have been in the Tome. Later, he also sends a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that's confirmed as the source of the [[Wanderer]] and [[Ever]]'s doing.
