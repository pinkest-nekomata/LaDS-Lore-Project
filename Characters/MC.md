Main Character

Captain: [[Jenna]]

Birth year: 2026 or 2027

# Evol and Power Level
MC has the rare [[Resonance Evol]], which may be the only of its kind, and one of only a few [[Anhaunsen Class]] Evols. Her power level isn't readable, however.

In [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#06 Dust]], an [[Ever]] hitman and one of the [[Backtrackers]] turned traitor discuss that "her powers aren't complete yet", "The one who strikes first is helping her [[cultivation]]", and "[[Ever]] will end up losing more than they bargained for once she develops."

In [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], [[Sylus]] notes that her power is only a fraction of what it once was. ( #todo, more specific citation)

# Timeline

## Quick Reference

2026/2027: Born

2034: Experiments begin and end, [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], age estimate 7-8, likely enrolled in 3rd grade (Since she's noted as a fast learner, Josephine would likely err on the side of the higher grade)

Year: Age range, grade STARTED (Caleb info)
2035: 8-9, 4th grade (Caleb 6th grade)
2036: 9-10, 5th grade (Caleb 7th grade)
2037: 10-11, 6th grade (Caleb 8th grade)
2038: 11-12, 7th grade (Caleb 9th grade)
2039: 12-13, 8th grade (Caleb 10th grade)
2040: 13-14, 9th grade (Caleb 11th grade)
2041: 14-15, 10th grade (Caleb 12th grade) << MC/Caleb overlap 1 year at HS
2042: 15-16, 11th grade (Caleb Freshman)
2043: 16-17, 12th grade (Caleb Sophomore)
2044: 17-18, Freshman (Caleb Junior)
2045: 18-19, Sophomore (Caleb Senior)
2046: 20-21, Junior (Caleb works for DAA)
2047: 21-22, Senior (Caleb works for DAA)
2048: 22-23, Finishes Senior year, Passes Hunter Exam, Main story starts, likely in Spring
* (Caleb works for DAA until [[Bloomshore District explosion]] which is likely mid-year)

Note: In China, 9th grade is typically middle school, with High School being 3 yrs (10-12th grade) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_China#Education_system)). Bachelors degrees are still typically 4 years. Academic year usually spans Sept to June, similar to the US. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_year#China))

## Details
MC's origins are mysterious. Nothing is known about her parents. She's the first test subject of the [[Gaia Research Center]] ([[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]]), and they don't know her exact age, listing it as 7-8 ([[Josephine's notes]]). Experiments on her started in 2034, about 1.5 months before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], meaning that she was born in 2026 or 2027.

In [[Josephine's notes]] and [[Josephine's secret notes]], we learn that she she was originally in an experiment for "life form observation", circa early summer 2034. Attributed to experiment error, her "energy values" rapidly escalated and resulted in an explosion of energy, after which she was medically dead. 14 hours later, she came back to life, albeit without her memories. Within days, she had regained all her cognitive function and then some, outperforming other children her age. The relief was short lived--the researchers voted to attempt to "kill" her again. Josephine ([[Grandma]]) protested, but the "experiment" proceeded anyway.

A larger energy burst occurred, and MC "died", then returned to life again. There are conspicuous parallels between this timing and what we know of the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] itself--Refer to the Theories section below.

While MC is still in the observation unit, the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] begins, and the observation unit is crushed and MC escapes. Her nightmares of "rusty-red rain" recall this time, and she remembers being saved by [[Lumiere]] ([[Xavier]]). She ends up at a shelter where she has a brief encounter with [[Zayne]] (who makes her popcicles) which she then forgets, and also meets [[Caleb]]. ((TBD whether this is the first time she meets him, or if he's another test subject--[[Josephine's secret notes]] vaguely mention Josephine taking in Caleb but don't refer to anything about another test subject.))

Josephine then finds MC and [[Caleb]] in the shelter and takes them in. MC's childhood is relatively normal from this point forward, though she does still have memory issues, resulting in the [[forgotten Rafayel promise]].

Especially in her Old Days memories with [[Caleb]], we can see she had a typical high school and college experience. She set her heart on becoming a [[Deepspace Hunter]], and passed the exams just before the main story begins.



# Theories

## MC and the Deepspace Tunnel
**Did MC's resurrections trigger the appearance of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]?**

When the researchers go to "kill" MC a second time, they put her back in the observation unit. A close reading of [[Josephine's secret notes]] reveals that MC was still in the observation unit when the catastrophe hit, meaning that her "resurrection" may have actually been at the same time as the [[Wanderer]]s appeared. If we assume it took Josephine 3-4 days to find MC (the text says "days later"), then MC's first "resurrection" would align with the beginning of the 3 day "polar night" that [[Jeremiah]] notes in [[WU-04 From The Stars]].

Given the close tie of [[Philos]] with [[MC]]'s life and [[Aether Core]] described in [[Shooting Stars]], it's feasible that MC's death could "reach across time and space" in this way.

This theory is also supported by [[Ever]] helping to fund [[Gaia Research Center]]. We know that some of the [[Backtrackers]] have turned traitor and are working with [[Ever]] and breaking the [[Nonintervention Principle]] (e.g. [[duckbill cap man]] in [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]]). Given that "Gaia" effectively means "Earth", and the [[Backtrackers]] are trying to find a way to save future-[[Philos]], their "observation project" may have been a way of trying to find a person/life form with [[Protocore]] energy compatible with [[Philos]], or even specifically [[MC]] herself (see also [[Queen MC]]).

So, [[Ever]] plus the traitor [[Backtrackers]] working to find energy for [[Philos]] resulting in a "portal" opening to where Philos used to be would be thematically appropriate, making this theory plausible. And since the [[Aether Core]] is portrayed as having unlimited mysterious power, it foreshadows some large effects like this.

To take it one step further, the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] doesn't only represent a portal to [[Philos]], but also the [[converging timelines]]. Since [[MC]] is the center of all those timelines, her memory loss during the "death" could hint at a connection between memory in general and her "death". In the process of temporarily losing her memories, she may actually be accessing the memories of all her lives across the universe, becoming the convergence point of all the timelines. Josephine even says something along those lines, when she finds MC at the shelter, "...those forgotten days were always there, invisibly linking us together."
