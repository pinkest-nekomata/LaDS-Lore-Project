# Summary

This story begins when MC is researching "the [[Aether Core]]" after her initial stint in the [[N109 Zone]]. ((This makes it most likely concurrent with [[Operation Aether Ordeal]].)) She's heard of [[Protofield]] disturbances in a [[small country in the south]]. Since commercial flights are blocked due to the [[Protofield]], she asks [[Luke and Kieran]] if private jets are allowed to land--and they let spill that Sylus will be heading there soon too.

MC invites herself over to [[Sylus's base]], eventually getting [[Sylus]] to agree to take her along if she can prove herself over the coming three days. He takes her to [[Sylus's luxury suite]] for the first time, where she explores the penthouse suite and gathers more "puzzle pieces" about Sylus--such as him being a good boxing teacher ([[Captivating Lesson]]), having an extensive music collection, and not being a show-off.

When [[Luke and Kieran]] reveal that [[Kovi]] has asked to play poker, [[MC]] invites herself along, taking this chance to prove herself. She ends up essentially hustling [[Kovi]], who underestimates her, to win the pot. When Kovi's bodyguard moves to act, [[MC]] skillfully disarms him and knocks him out, using Sylus's advice to improve her punches. Kovi lets them leave, though it's revealed that there are many people tailing them.

Still, Sylus and MC pause for breakfast in a park at sunrise, and Sylus reveals that he misses live plants when he's in the N109 Zone, and also that he's fond of small animals when he feeds tuna to a group of stray cats. They hop onto Sylus's motorcycle to slip away from Kovi's men--then head straight for the airport.

MC is surprised to leave so soon, but doesn't complain. Soon, they're in the [[small country in the south]], in another one of Sylus's residences. This one also has a private boxing gym, so MC helps herself, much to [[Luke and Kieran]]'s surprise. The chef calls out sick so they end up making salad ([[Captivating Flavor]]) and then eating together on the terrace.

Sylus gifts her the [[Harrier 700]], and tells her he'll need to "use" her that night. They head to the meeting with [[General Rowan]], where it's quickly revealed that Rowan intends to trap and kill [[Sylus]]--along with [[Kovi]]'s help. Sylus and MC fight their way to the roof together, where Sylus surprises her by "falling" off the roof with her. His Evol controls their descent, and as soon as they land, he sets off a bomb, destroying the top floor where their enemies still are.

They banter briefly about Sylus helping MC with her [[Wanderer]] research, and Sylus affirms that he's also collecting puzzle pieces about her as well.

# Commentary

## Sylus's plans
One of the key thematic quotes for this myth (which is also an in-battle voice line) is "With you here, I only need one plan". Sylus is used to thinking ten steps ahead, as revealed earlier in this myth, and also used to working alone since other people tend to be dead weight or a liability. However, this line subtly reveals that Sylus trusts in MC's strength and doesn't feel a need to make any contingency plans if she fails--he trusts that she won't.

With this in mind, we can take a closer look at some of Sylus's machinations in this myth.

### Three days to prove yourself
It should be noted that Sylus seems genuinely skeptical when MC first appears and demands to be taken along. This three-day deal likely serves two purposes: One, he really does want to make sure she's ready, especially after a shaky start in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]]. Two, he wants to spend the time with her, but isn't willing to be straightforward about that yet.

Sylus quickly updates when MC continues to impress him. She has more boxing skill than he expected and she's a quick learner. He's also recalibrating--how much is too much to push her? How much does she really want to be here? What are her goals? He's closely observing her, trying to piece it all together. And when she catches him observing her, that's another (ultimately pleasant) surprise.

By the time they have the altercation with [[Kovi]], Sylus realizes there's no longer any need to keep [[MC]] out of dangerous situations. She's proven that they won't shake her resolve, and that she wants to be there. Really, he seems less worried about her getting hurt (since he's more than able to protect her) and more worried about her feeling that he's pestering her, dragging her into things, or generally ruining her life.

This is probably why Sylus is willing to take her to the [[small country in the south]] so quickly, in addition to whatever movements of [[Kovi]]'s and [[General Rowan]]'s that he was aware of.

### Confrontation with General Rowan
[[Sylus]] is clearly unsurprised by [[General Rowan]]'s betrayal. Though he downplays it, it seems pretty clear that he brought a bomb in the briefcase instead of any goods to trade. Telling MC that he winged it is perhaps his way of testing her--confirming that she's using her brain and able to see through his "lies".

It seems likely that he moved up the trip, insisting on seeing Rowan that night, not the next day--because he knew Kovi and Rowan would be working together. Indeed, Kovi would have needed to travel down to that country the same day, and MC's comment about the briefcase implies that she knew this deal was also about the new weapon whose "bid" she won during the poker game.
