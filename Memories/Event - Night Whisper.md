*Note: This may not be a complete transcript, but all dialogue is included:*

> MC: What do you want to do first? Make a wish and blow out the candle or read the card I wrote for you?
> Sylus: You kept writing after you gave me the invitation? I’ll read the card.
> MC: This is the first time I’m celebrating your birthday with you. I wrote down everything I wanted to say.
> *Looking at the card, he smiles. His fingertips brush over it with the same tender touch he usually reserves for my cheek.*
> *His gaze carefully examines each word, and he takes in every like before finally looking up.*
> Sylus: I always tell you to speak your mind. But… now I understand there’s something special about having words written down too. I’ll keep this card. And the invitation.
> MC: In the top drawer of your safe?
> Sylus: Somewhere within reach.
> `Presenting the cake`
> MC: I made this myself. Even though I haven’t tasted it yet… Trust me, it’ll be delicious.
> Sylus: Food made with such confidence can hardly disappoint, especially when you made it. We found so many jewels together, but this one will always be my favorite.
> MC: I had one thing in mind when I made this… I wanted to create something that would make this day unforgettable for you. Did I succeed, Sylus?
> Sylus: You never fail.
> *The candlelight flickers in Sylus’s eyes. It dances with the joy that hasn’t left his gaze.*
> MC: Happy Birthday, Sylus.
> `(Player's opportunity to sing Happy Birthday)`
> Sylus: Let me tell you something that’s not exactly a secret. This is the first time anyone has sung ‘Happy Birthday’ to me.
> MC: Don’t forget to make a wish before you blow out the candle.
> Sylus: Will it come true if I make one?
> MC: If you believe in it, yeah.
> Sylus: I wish for you to always life freely and brilliantly.
> MC: Aren’t birthday wishes supposed to be about yourself? Why did you make one about me?
> Sylus: “Who said it wasn’t for myself? Someone suddenly came into my life and said she wanted to see me remain strong… to always be undefeated. I can do that. But then… She said she also wanted to see me be vulnerable. I wanted to tell her that I couldn’t do such a thing. But the truth is… _she_ is my vulnerability. So, only when she lives boldly and freely will this ‘weakness’ of mine have meaning. This wish was always meant for us.
> *Behind us, a stunning sunset paints the sky. Yet we don’t even look at it in this moment. It’s okay. This is just the beginning of spring, and we have all the time in the world. We’ll surely see countless more beautiful sights and share more stories together.*
