> I follow his gaze to see the car parked in the depths of an endless forest.
> Sylus takes me to a villa. Its exterior is elegant and tranquil, but my eyes widen the minute he opens the door.
> There's no furniture inside. It's just weapons, piled up to the point where they could reach the ceiling.
> It's basically a weapon museum.
> MC: Don't you already have an armory in the N109 Zone?
> Sylus: One isn't enough. Also, the weapons in the [[N109 Zone]] are new. The ones here are antiques.
