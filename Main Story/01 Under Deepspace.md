# Summary
[[MC]] becomes a [[Deepspace Hunter]] and takes on her first mission. In the process, she meets [[Xavier]], a deepspace hunter and her mysterious mission partner, and [[Rafayel]], an artist who's been implicated in the odd behavior (and later death) of an art collector, [[Raymond]]. Along the way, [[MC]] checks in with [[Zayne]], her childhood friend and primary care physician. We learn that she has [[Protocore Syndrome]], caused by [[Protocore fragments]] around her heart, yet she's decided to take on the dangerous job as a hunter anyway.

Just as [[MC]] is getting into the hang of things as a hunter, tragedy strikes. While on a planned visit to see [[Grandma]] and her adopted brother [[Caleb]] at [[MC's childhood home]], an explosion occurs, setting her home ablaze and apparently killing both [[Grandma]] and [[Caleb]]. (Later, we'll learn that [[Ever]] salvaged [[Caleb]]'s body from the wreckage, and he paid a high price to survive.)

For the next six months, [[MC]] throws herself into her work researching the [[modified Protocore]] that she and [[Xavier]] found in a [[Flux Nexus]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] on her first full day as a hunter. MC refuses to believe that the explosion was just a [[Wanderer]]-related accident, which is the official explanation. She ignores [[Zayne]]'s orders to rest, earning the worry of [[Tara]] and Captain [[Jenna]], who urge her to take care of herself.

Finally, her weariness catches up with her, and she ends up falling asleep at the hospital while waiting for a checkup with [[Zayne]]. This seems to signal to [[Zayne]] that he's better off giving [[MC]] something that [[Grandma]] had left for her--a small box sealed with a fingerprint sensor.

Once she's home, [[MC]] opens the box to find [[Josephine's notes]]--experimental records about her as a test subject. With her world turned upside down, MC reaches back to [[Zayne]] for more answers, and he suggests they head to the [[Arctic]] to ask [[Dr. Noah]], MC's first cardiologist.

Once in the [[Arctic]], [[Dr. Noah]] explains that [[Grandma]] was a researcher. Since [[Dr. Noah]] never saw any evidence of prior surgery in [[MC]]'s exams, his best guess is that the [[Aether Core]] next to her heart is something innate to her. However, he cautions here that there are many powerful people who would want it, so she should avoid sharing this secret with others.

Back in [[Linkon]], MC tries to research [[Onychinus]], a mysterious organization in the [[N109 Zone]] that's responsible for the [[modified Protocore]]. Furthermore, MC concludes something that even the [[Hunters Association]] cannot: based on information in [[Josephine's notes]], the protocores must have been modified with an [[Aether Core]], meaning [[Onychinus]] has one.

After another chance meeting with [[Xavier]] turns chaotic, [[Xavier]] agrees to give her more intel on the [[N109 Zone]]. With temporary access to [[Xavier]]'s elevated permissions, she gets the contact info for an anonymous informant. When getting info on a suspicious murder of an [[Ever]] researcher from two years ago, she hears the voice of the culprit. (She doesn't yet know, but this is [[Sylus]].) She also learns of a bounty on [[Rafayel]]'s head.

MC heads over to check and make sure [[Rafayel]]'s alright, but he already knows about the bounty. He uses the opportunity to get her to come to [[Hat Island]] with him, promising her a way into the [[N109 Zone]] in return. Once they defeat the [[Deluge Wyrmlord]] and [[Rafayel]] has its [[Protocore]], he gives MC an invitation to [[Hunting Day]] at [[The Nest]].

MC scopes out [[The Nest]], running into [[Xavier]] there. He has her follow her away from the nest and to [[Azure Square]], but once he realizes he can't dissuade her from going into the [[N109 Zone]], he agrees to give her a little more help. Once dispatching some [[patrol robot]]s that were following them, they head to the flower shop [[Philo]].

Xavier's old friend and co-member of the [[Backtrackers]], [[Jeremiah]], creates a fake identity for MC as the heiress of a mysterious criminal syndicate. This will help keep her alive. Xavier also gives her a variety of tools, including an [[inhibitor pill]] that will make her temporarily immune to neurotoxin.

Thus prepared, [[MC]] heads to [[The Nest]] for [[Hunting Day]]. Her plan to get captured goes off without a hitch, and a [[Man in Black]] doses her with neurotoxin so he can take her into the [[N109 Zone]].

Meanwhile, [[Rafayel]] discusses his own deal with the [[mysterious Ever representative]].
