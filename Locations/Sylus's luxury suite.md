Features in [[Captivating Moment]]. At the [[Solon Hotel]].

* The building has an underground parking lot.
* It's a presidential suite on the top floor.
* It also includes the floor below it.

> By the time I pick out a bedroom to sleep in, Sylus is nowhere to be seen.
> I take the elevator to the floor below. Unlike the suite on the top floor, this looks more like something you'd see in a normal hotel.
> Hallways connect the rooms. There's no one around, and many of the doors are open.
> As I walk, I realize these aren't guest rooms. One is a mini theater, another a gym... There's a karaoke room, a gaming room, and a boxing ring. I even see a swimming pool.
> Are all of them for Sylus's personal use?

The top floor includes a music room:
> What greets me is a wall covered in records and all sorts of exquisite musical instruments.
> Sylus sits on the sofa facing the full-length windows. He gazes outside into the night, and his leg rests on the coffee table. He holds a glass of red wine in one hand and appears very relaxed.
