A forested area with some ruins. Parts are more intact than others. There's an old signal station and a [[Flux Nexus]].

# Spacepedia
Originally a forest surrounding Linkon City, it was chosen as the location for a cosmic signal station. It was one of the places first attacked during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], and the signal station was destroyed. Now, a large number of [[Wanderer]]s live here.
