Mentioned in [[Captivating Moment]].

> Recently, a [[small country in the south]] has experience abnormal magnetic [[fluctuation]] and a surge in [[Wanderer]]s. I suspect it's related to the [[Aether Core]] and want to go investigate.

It's a tropical area, and the country's traditional clothes are bright and vibrant. There's a bustling market visible from the hotel. It's a lively place that [[MC]] has wanted to vacation to for a while. ([[Captivating Moment - Ch 7]])



# Real-world parallels
Though [[Linkon]] is intentionally vague in its "real" location, the game's main markets are CN, JP, and KN so a "small country to the south" can be understood as paralleling south east Asia--i.e. the general area of Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, etc.
