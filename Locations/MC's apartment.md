**391 Garden South St** ([[01-06.08 Evening Breeze]])

On the 5th floor. [[Xavier's apartment]] is above it on the 6th floor.

The building is in the city center, within walking distance of the [[Bloomshore District]] (or potentially within the district). ([[Xavier]] and [[MC]] stop for noodles at [[Harmonious Mart]] on the way back during [[01-06.07 At Midnight]].)

There's an fenced courtyard with an outer door. The building itself says No.9 on the front.

From [[01-06.08 Evening Breeze]]:
The outer wall alternates a warm oranges wood paneling and speckled concrete. It has a modern design. There's an access pad and a slatted metal door to enter. To the left of the door, the address is shown (391 Garden South St), with a geometric symbol over it. Past the gate, the street address is repeated and the building is labeled No 9.

Within the wall, there's a courtyard with trees, paths, planted flower beds, and lighting. The balconies have both a warm and historic quality (with the turned spindles visible above the main entrance) and a modern, rectangular, geometric design.
