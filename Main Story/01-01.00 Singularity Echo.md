## Commentary
A [Gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), in general relativity, is a point in which gravity is so intense that [[spacetime]] itself becomes ill-defined. This hints at the general [[spacetime]] shenanigans in the story, including the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], the [[converging timelines]], and the time travel of the [[Backtrackers]] (whose ship is the [[Traceback II]]).
