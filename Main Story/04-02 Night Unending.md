# Summary
MC wakes to realize she's missed her appointment with [[Kevi]] and [[Zayne]]. ((Later, Caleb effectively confesses to drugging her on purpose to keep her "home".)) As she tries to figure out what's happened, she runs into [[Caleb]], who's still trying to pretend things are normal. He's interrupted by a phone call--[[Mia]] is dead. ([[04-02.01 Awakening]])

At Mia's funeral, Kevi's behavior is strange. ((Later, we learn that [[Professor Lucius]] "adopted" Kevi and implanted a [[Toring chip]] to control him.)) Caleb tries to throw MC off the trail, but when she gets a moment alone, [[Viper]] gives her a tip to head over to [[Lucius's Villa]] the next afternoon. He also gives her a signal jammer. ([[04-02.02 Funeral]])

The next day, MC uses the signal jammer to get into the villa and finds [[Kevi]] who gives an emotionless and disturbing report of what the Professor has told him, while also considering breaking a bird's wings to keep it in the courtyard. After, MC overhears [[Professor Lucius]] and [[Caleb]] talking about "cleanup" and "salvaging". ([[04-02.03 Lurking]])

She then touches base with the [[Hunters Association]] before making plans to meet with Caleb again and give him back [[Caleb's necklace]] modified with a Hunter-issue [[stealth monitoring chip]]. ([[04-02.03 Lurking]]) They meet at a supernova viewing and MC remembers how they talked about that same supernova when they were kids--and also how Caleb was meant to protect her like a planet's rings protect it. ([[04-02.04 Annihilation]])

That night, MC uses the tracker to follow Caleb to the [[Final Clean-Up]]. Here she discovers that the real goal is to kill the [[human-like Wanderer]]s that have resulted from failed human experiments. ([[04-02.05 Covert Operation]]) Caleb finds MC, then brings her back to a Fleet ship to tend to her wounds. By the next morning, it's clear he doesn't want to let her go ([[04-02.07 Dark Side]]) so MC bides her time and attempts to escape. In the process, she learns the name of the [[Toring chip]] from [[Cybezin]] product labeling. Caleb catches her again, moving her back to [[Caleb's place]] ([[04-02.08 Escape]]) where he then keeps her for three days. 

Their confrontation escalates ([[04-02.09 Captive Bird]]), but ultimately they're at a stalemate by the time MC says goodbye. Caleb heads to his mission (or so it seems) and MC heads to Linkon. ([[04-02.10 Crossroads]])

We get a scene from Caleb/omniscient POV that reveals many twists. Most importantly, [[Professor Lucius]] is still looking for [[MC]] to use her power, and [[The Fountain of Atei]] is almost ready to be deployed. This is a big lore dump, so it's recommended to review the chapter itself: [[04-02.10 Crossroads]]
