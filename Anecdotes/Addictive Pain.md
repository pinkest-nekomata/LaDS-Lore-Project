# Anecdote
Relevant LI: [[Rafayel]]
Main POV character: [[Rafayel]]
Associated Companion: [[Rafayel - Fresh Paint]]

A couple years ago, [[Rafayel]] takes over the [[Linkon]] art world, quietly gaining proximity to [[MC]]

## Summary
The events of [[Siren's Song]] happen directly before this anecdote.

Rafayel arrives in [[Linkon]] searching for [[MC]], and quickly makes a splash in the art world. When asked why he returned to [[Linkon]], he muses that it's for an addictive, painful sensation--like eating spicy food. This relates to Rafayel's pain-as-inspiration theme which is also mentioned in [[Intertidal Zone]].

Realizing [[MC]] is still in college, he takes on a gig as a visiting professor at [[Linkon University]] to be close to her. His inquiries reveal that there are many others involved in [[surveillance on MC]], but he's content to bide his time. Just being one step closer to her is enough for now. Though he his close enough to hear her voice and see her photo, he doesn't risk getting closer.

## Commentary
The World Underneath story [[WU-08 Micro Universe]] also references [[Rafayel]]'s time at [[Linkon University]], most likely over the spring semester during his year as a visiting professor. Or, he may have extended his agreement with the university.

# 01 Ignition
It's a tranquil summer in [[Linkon]] City. But then a masterpiece called *Illusion* goes viral, making its painter, [[Rafayel]], instantly famous.

After the exhibition, journalists descend on Rafayel. Notably, one asks about the "sudden decision to return to your homeland" and another says "Some speculate that you're actually royalty from a certain maritime civilization" (i.e. [[Lemuria]]). When one asks why he decided to come to Linkon, he says "[[Linkon]] City and the people within it invoke [sic, should be "evoke"] a sense of wonder for me." ((Notably, we soon learn he's here for [[MC]], adding meaning to his next responses.))

They ask him to describe the feeling, and he describes it as "spice smeared on your hand, on the tip of your tongue." Musing to himself, he elaborates:
> Only he knows it's not a matter of taste, but a sense of perception.
> An addictive, painful kind.

# 02 Another Disguise
In his hotel room, Rafayel is checking his email, and a subject about Linkon's universities catches his eye.
> "University... She should still be a college student."

The message had been forwarded to him by an unspecified sender with the message:
> "[[Linkon University]]. That's where the person you're looking for is."
* ((This person reveals themselves in chapter 03 below.))

As Rafayel thinks of a way to hang around [[Linkon University]] without attracting undue attention, he collects his mail, which includes letters of invitation to give lectures. This gives him the idea to accept an invitation from [[Linkon University]] to be a guest lecturer.

Rafayel gives the lecture, musing that [[MC]] is in the school, "possibly within reach." The Dean of the College of Fine Arts invites him to be a visiting professor for a year, and he says he'll consider it.

# 03 A New Player
Rafayel is in a private booth at [[The Nest]], talking to the person who sent him the email. That person then reveals a file:
> "Here's what you requested. Quite a few people are keeping an eye on her. From what I can see, some have been planning for years. They're setting things into motion. The threads of fate have already spun around her. You're entering the game late, but... If we act immediately, we might just get the upper hand by catching the others off guard."

Rafayel asks for more info on the others involved, but the contact doesn't have it. He does share a picture of her:
> "She's just an ordinary college student, going to class during the day and spending time with friends afterward. She sometimes joins in extracurricular activities. She's completely unaware of us."

Rafayel warns him to keep his distance and not do anything unnecessary, then incinerates the files, delivering a threat that the contact had better behave or he'll "never be able to work with anyone ever again."

# 04 Bait
[[Rafayel]] returns to [[Linkon University]], appreciating the peaceful and beautiful campus in late summer. Though he notes:
> She is only bait, disguised as a [[tiny red fish]].

He muses that she might be nearby and he hasn't seen her yet, also noting:
> No matter where she is, her aura has already attracted too many predators that don't belong in these waters. [...] there might be someone lurking in the shadows, using her as bait to capture him.

Rafayel decides he has plenty of time to take it slow and safe:
> He wants to settle the score with her, bit by bit, slowly and steadily.
> At this thought, a deep-seated pain stings his heart, gradually seeping down, permeating his entire being. This process is undeniably painful, yet it's addictive.
* This is a reference to the events of [[Forgotten Sea]], and the [[Lemurian disaster]] also mentioned in [[WU-03 Bouquets and Dirges#02 Wedding]].

There's a scoreboard nearby, and a picture of [[MC]] happens to be there. Though she's older than when he saw her during the [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]], "her eyes still twinkle with the same mirth as they always had."

He asks nearby students where students from that major take their classes, and gets a clue as to where on campus she might frequent.
> The more information he learns, the less hurried he feels.
> For every step they take, it will only take a few to reunite.
> Besides, he has taken the bait she used once before.

# 05 Unexpected Encounter
A week later, Rafayel agrees to be a visiting professor for a year. His first lecture series is "Lost Sea: [[Lemuria]]'s Art and Civilization."
* ((This does make it a bit funny when he later claims to know nothing about Lemuria, but that seems well in-character for [[Rafayel]].))

Soon after, at the cafeteria, he happens to be sitting near [[MC]] and hears her voice. She mentions something about the sea, leading him to reminisce about the [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]]. A friend mentions the lecture series, but [[MC]] admits to not noticing it, being too busy preparing for her "thesis proposal". He finds it odd that she's confused about [[Lemuria]] (likely because he doesn't yet know she's forgotten their encounter). Rafayel then leaves the cafeteria.

# 06 A Perfect Opportunity
With the Lemuria lecture series complete, students ask what's next. Rafayel creates a painting using chili peppers as a pigment, painting with his hands and savoring the pain. To the students, he comments on how color is a sensation. The students ask if he'll stay for another exhibition, and how they can keep up with him. He muses internally:
> Perhaps he will remain in [[Linkon]] City for a long time.
> After all, he has yet to formally invite an art appreciator, and his paint is still not properly mixed.
> The perfect moment will happen in the distant future.
