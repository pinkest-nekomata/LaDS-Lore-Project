## Commentary

### Dragon Core
The Spacepedia entry is from MC's perspective, so it may not be strictly accurate that his eye's power is an [[Aether Core]] like hers. When she asks Sylus if that's what his eye is, he sighs and says, "Sure. Think of it like that." ([[02-02.06 Agreement]])

Given that an "Aether Core" is essentially any particularly powerful Protocore, there's no real contradiction here, but there's reason to avoid generalizing Sylus's abilities to other Aether Cores. 

Notably, in [[Xianxia]], dragons are one of the types of mystical/divine beasts that can be born with a "Beast Core". Applying that trope, as a dragon, Sylus would have been born with his core vs. needing to undergo [[cultivation]] as MC does with. her 'Cultivation Core'. See also [[Cores in Xianxia]].
