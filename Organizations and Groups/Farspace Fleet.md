# Spacepedia
The Farspace Fleet gained public recognition following its establishment in [[Skyhaven]]. It possesses formidable patrol and combat capabilities in the depths of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], carrying out missions of the highest security clearance. 
The Fleet maintains strict internal management and classified operations throughout its ranks, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to obtain any intelligence.
