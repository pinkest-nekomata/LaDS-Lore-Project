# Summary
[[Xavier]] reveals that he knows that MC is the [[Chosen One]], and he's interested in her because only the Dead can live in [[Sindersfell]], but she's alive. He lets her go, and she wanders out of the monestary, meeting [[revenant]]s along the way. She gets directions to the city at the base of the mountains, then is attacked by a group of [[Grandis Knight]]s. [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] saves her, cutting the [[revenant]]s down. This is the kindled scene of [[Nightvow Mooncurse]].

More revenants appear, and after "killing" them, [[Xavier]] appears to be injured and weakened. His blood reveals he's also alive, and MC makes a camp and a fire to allow him to rest.

It's revealed that the [[revenant]]s are trapped in an endless cycle--Xavier cuts them down and they respawn with every cycle of the moon. Traveling together, they pass through a graveyard where MC finds a tombstone engraving from [[Philos]] about the [[Grandis Knight]]s and the [[Order of Lightseekers]]. Xavier says the knights hate him because of what happened when they were alive, but doesn't elaborate.

They arrive at the ferry over the [[Sinders]] to the city, and MC pays with silver coins she found in the tombs. Since [[Xavier]] didn't have a coin, he now owes her two debts--one for helping save his life and one for the coin. As the ferry arrives, MC accidentally touches the water and has a memory of [[Philos]], and a young knight ([[Xavier]]) becoming King. [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] leaves her at this point.

## Commentary

# Details

> A tale circulates every corner of [[Sindersfell]].
> There was once a glorious kingdom called [[Philos]]. It fell during a catastrophic war.
> Everything perished, and a void swallowed the land. Death's shadow swept through every nook and cranny.
> Yet if one could find the [[Tree of Life]] that connects life and death, they shall be reborn. They'll be able to embark on a journey home.
> And the one who will be their guide and light the path is the [[Chosen One]] of [[Philos]].

Still at swordpoint, MC correctly guesses that Xavier already knows she's the [[Chosen One]]. She tries to bargain for her life.

Of the [[revenant]]s, Xavier says:
> They must pay the price for pursuing eternity.

Xavier says she's caught his interest because only the dead can live in [[Sindersfell]], but she's alive. He also reveals that his blade can only harm the Dead. He takes interest in her cut palm, bandaging it.

Then he leaves, warning her to stay alert.

Outside, MC orients by the position of the giant, gloomy castle.
> No matter where you are in Philos, you need only look up to see the imposing, gloomy castle. In its opulence, it stands with solitary majesty.

A trio of revenants offer some information, one of them referring to Philos as the "Land of Light and Eternity" and affirming that all the revenants hate Xavier. They recommend a city at the base of the mountains, and offer directions.

> *The Fourth Moonlit Night*

MC continues her journey, wary of the swamp that swallows everything except the crescent of the waning moon. 
* ((Note that [[Sindersfell]] represents an inversion of [[Philos]], and while the moon (especially the rabbit in the moon) is a symbol of Xavier, the new moon (which happens after the waning crescent) is a symbol of [[Xavier - King of Darknight]].))

She finds a group of [[Grandis Knight]]s. They say, "May Philos prosper under eternity's divine gaze!"

When they hear MC's footsteps, they say "only the Living can make that sound" and ask if it's the [[Mad King]], implying that he's also alive. Seeing MC, they say "she carries his essence." They demand to know if she's pledged herself to eternity. When she's confused, they attack her as a traitor.

The Kindled scene of [[Nightvow Mooncurse]] begins, and [[forget-me-nots]] glow amidst the grass. MC summons her staff, and the attacking [[revenant]]s look like [[Wanderer]]s. Xavier swoops in, cutting them down and pulling her onto his horse.

Once safe, the grass is full of [[Lumenflora]], which resemble glowing lillies. Xavier warns her that the dead are caught in a perpetual cycle of painful death, and he warns her to leave while she can, or she'll meet the same fate. They briefly discuss the prophecy and [[Sindersfell]].

More [[revenant]]s appear, and one curses [[Xavier]]:
> Xavier... I curse you. You shall never find deliverance! You will be devoured in the act of slaughter...!
> Xavier: Is that so? May your last words come to fruition.

His eyes glow eerie blue as he wields his sword. This is the end of the kindled scene.

Xavier cuts down the remaining [[revenant]]s, and their armor reveals them to be knights of [[Philos]].

Injured, he falls against her. His blood confirms he's alive. He asks for her help, and she sets up a camp, starting a fire. This becomes a classic sleepy Xavier moment, if extra grumpy.

> While connecting the pieces of information in my mind, my gaze shifts to the sword lying half a meter away.
> It's a greatsword that devours light.
> Aside from the back of the blade being thick, the weapon itself is completely black. Mysterious runes are inscribed on the sword, and they surge with light whenever it's swung.
> MC: Does your weapon have a name?
> Xavier: No. It's just a sword.

> *Day 2*

The next day, they set out again on his spectral steed, traversing the forest. Xavier kills the [[revenant]]s along the way, and they continue to curse and insult him.

MC asks questions, and Xavier explains that the [[revenant]]s reanimate with every cycle of the moon, and their reasons for hating him go back to when they were truly alive.

They continue on, arriving at a rain soaked mass grave near the site of a massive battle.

Text on a tombstone reads:
> In a chaotic era, kingdoms fall like shooting stars.
> The [[Order of Lightseekers]] fought until they breathed their last breath.
> Countless blood-soaked battles fought, with unwavering courage.
> Their tales live on in song, their heroic deeds forever engraved in our hearts.
> In the Year XXXXX of the [[Philos]] Calendar, the Kingdom fell.
> The royal capital was destroyed, and the royal bloodline was extinguished.
> The knights, our exalted, honorable guardians...
> They now rest in the silence of a long night.
> On the day the Order ceased to exist, Their names shall be carved into these historical monuments under eternity's divine gaze.
> Like the stars, they are distant but never cease to shine.
* ((This is a direct reference to the [[Shooting Stars]] myth, which heavily features the [[Order of Lightseekers]], of which [[Xavier - Lightseeker]] and [[Queen MC]] are a part. [[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 4]] will elaborate on how we get from MC being queen to Xavier taking the throne.))

Xavier asks what she's looking at, and she replies she's looking for her own name.

> MC: Philos didn't meet its demise until I was "gone" for many years. For those who once knew me, I must've died early. If I wasn't an exiled prisoner, then someone should have remembered me. It's possible they made a memorial.
> Xavier: Is being remembered that important to you?
> *I'm unsure of when he had lifted his cloak to shield me from the rain.*
> MC: These knights fought for their country when they lived. After they died, their tombstones were used to pave roads... Being remembered isn't important. But if no one remembers you, then isn't that the same as never existing in the first place?

He ignores her question, saying they should move on. At the new moon, they reach the ferry where [[revenant]]s wait to cross. They give Xavier a wide berth. The ferryman demands payment, and since Xavier doesn't have a coin, MC pays for him too with the coins she found in the graves.
* ((Note the similarities to the River Styx ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx)), especially the strict requirement of one coin per person.))

Revenants try to cling to the boat until the ferryman shoos them away.

On the ferry, MC brings up his debts of "half his life" and the coin, trying to bargain for his sword. He refuses, but really she was just trying to soften him up to ask for something else. He warns her to not give away kindness so easily in this place.

As the boat reaches the other side, it lurches, and MC's hand touches the river's water, pulling her into an illusive memory.

She sees flags, flowers, a bright marble staircase, a young knight ascending to the throne amidst cheers. We see [[Xavier - Lightseeker]]. The crown is placed on his head, and a [[Lumenflora]] is pinned to his lapel.

The flashback shifts to a battle:
> Fortifications crumble, ruins cover the land... The royal capital, once peaceful, has become a battlefield shrouded in war's smoke.
> The rebel army storms the capital. They force the young king to take his own life.
> Yet their swords are melted into liquid steel in the furnace and cast onto the throne itself.
> Peace is restored to the Kingdom a century later.
> There are no more casualties from the war for hundreds of years, yet people have come to despise this monarch.
> The knight, once adored by thousands, is now reviled. He is nothing more than a "mad king."
* ((It's not immediately clear how/if the king survives.))

The ferry arrives on the other side. As MC comes to, Xavier is disappearing.
