# Spacepedia
Wanderers create an alternate dimension using an energy field. Currently, all relevant information is from hunters who've fought them. Because of the threats lurking in these mysterious Protofields, the [[Hunters Association]] requires two [[Evolver]]s to be present so they can support each other. They must also be ready to retreat should one of them encounter any danger.

**Stellacrum**
The spectrographic image, generated by scanning energy waves within a planet's Protofield using Protofield Imaging, reveals the fluctuating properties of [[Metaflux]] during combat.
So far, six types of Stellacrum have been identified: Emerald, Sapphire, Violet, Amber, Ruby, and Pearl. When the Stellacrum used in combat matches the ones on the field, its effects are amplified twofold.

# Other Info
In practice, Protofields are both a dimension that [[Wanderer]]s can pull hunters into (depicted as shimmering blue portals) and also a sort of field of influence that they can project out. "Protofield anomalies" can be observed without going into one, and can cause changes in the surrounding [[Metaflux]], including summoning more [[Wanderer]]s. ([[Never-Ending Winter]], [[01-05.10 Battle - Freezing Cold - Challenge]], [[N109 Zone]], etc.)


((Given that a [[Protocore]] is compared to a planet in [[01-03.10 Invitation]], it's possible that the reference to "planet" in the Stellacrum section above may be a mis-translation, and it's meant to refer to the Protofield itself. Not very consequential either way.))
