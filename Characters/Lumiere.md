In the midst of the 2034 [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], a mysterious hunter emerged, taking down numerous formidable [[Wanderer]]s and rescuing countless citizens in [[Linkon]] City. This enigmatic hunter played a crucial role in resolving the crisis. Their true identity remains shrouded in mystery, and after the catastrophe, they disappeared without a trace. They appeared again the last two years, with rumors suggesting that they have already transformed into [[Tenebra]].

# Other Info

Lumiere is really [[Xavier]].

If he reappeared within the last 2 years, he would have reappeared in approx 2046, depending on timing. Councidentally, this means Lumiere reappeared around the same time that [[Sylus]] took in [[Luke and Kieran]].
