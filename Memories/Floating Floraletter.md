**Description**
> One day, I accidentally discovered some "letters" that Caleb had written to me...

Tags: #kindled-kiss, #first-kiss
# Summary
While waiting for Caleb, MC discovers a stash of letters from Caleb to her that were never sent. Caleb says they were standard fleet protocol--the implication is that they'd write "goodbye" letters to their loved ones before risky missions, just in case. He tells her to ignore them and tries to brush it off, but MC ends up keeping them and reading them. Meanwhile, Caleb is trying to downplay the severity of a recent "emergency landing" (crash landing) that severely injured his remaining arm. He and MC travel to the site where he finds the precious thing he's looking for--a thumb drive with pictures and videos of him and MC that he takes on all his risky missions.

Later, Caleb invites MC on a surprise spring outing. He takes her to the same island where the ship crash landed, which is now overflowing with flowers due to changes in the island's Protofield caused during the crash. The Kindled scene depicts a playful moment in a rowboat and their first kiss. MC tells him she doesn't want him writing anymore "goodbye" letters--from now on, they'll only say "hello".

At the end, Caleb has a flashback to his near-death experience during the crash, and the way that his bond with MC is what gave him the strength to make it back to her.
