# Summary
The [[revenant]]s relive the battle that destroyed [[Philos]], with the [[Bishop]] leading the forces against [[Xavier]] alone. His blade no longer works against the [[revenant]]s. She doesn't want him to remain alone in the darkness until the world collapses. They resonate, forming new lightblades that cut down the revenants.

As the Apocalypse begins, light breaks through and turns the [[revenant]]s to [[Wanderer]]s and crystals. As [[Shadowbind]] disappears, MC falls but [[Xavier]] catches her.

The kindled scene from [[Nightvow Requiem]] begins. They sit in a flowery field, having a warm and familiar moment. They kiss. The scene suddenly cuts to the dark, silent battlefield. The flowers they put on their wrists are dry and withered. As Xavier says they'll always be together, they collapse together on the pile of corpses.

In a memory of Knight Xavier, he tells a young child that "eternity" didn't always mean individual people living forever, but rather, humans passing on stories through generations.

MC drifts through darkness, watching time rewind as gentle light surrounds her, and the tree thanks her for choosing Xavier.

The scene changes to the royal gardens in spring. A young Xavier selects a sword as his weapon of choice, and his mother talks with him about the responsibility of a knight, and the kind of person he'll be. The key sentiment is "You shall have peace in your heart only when you wield your sword for the choices you've made of your own free will."

Later in summer, Xavier's teacher scolds him, [[Isaiah]], and [[Jeremiah]], revealing that the [[Traceback I]] was [[Xavier]]'s idea, and that the [[Backtrackers]] already existed at this point with a secret base under the library. [[Xavier]] is preparing to turn his back on the royal family, implying he knows the truth of the [[Heart of the Planet]]. As they argue, [[Soren]] chimes in about being dedicated to the voyage.

In autumn, Xavier assures the person he's speaking to that she's a good queen.

The scene changes to space, and the [[Traceback II]] launches, heading for an unknown universe. [[Xavier]] doesn't sleep. MC's cosmic presence concludes that "in the universe where time still has an end, he must've gone to where I am."

## Commentary
### False faith
This chapter and the last key in on some themes of "false faith" with the people who were sacrificed for eternity wanting their deaths to have "meaning" and this then requiring that more people are sacrificed so Philos is maintained.

[[Xavier]] is regarded as having "destroyed" [[Philos]] because he revealed that their gods aren't real and showed them the truth of the planet's energy source.
### Philos's kings
In the spring scene, we get this description:
> He follows his mother's gaze toward the corridor. It's lined with shining, golden portraits of past Philosian kings.

It's not initially clear how this squares with [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], which describes [[Xavier]] as being the son of the king when [[Philos]] is only 215 years old, and Xavier's father is described as being the last of the kings. So perhaps all these kings spanned the 215 years? It's unclear how "new" immortality was at that point, but it was definitely established at the time of that anecdote.

### The divergence point
The final conclusion is that MC's willingness to go back in time allows her to manifest in the main story timeline, and also changes fate so that Xavier joins her there, instead of being stuck in a loop on an unsuccessful [[Traceback II]] mission (or going to a version of Earth that doesn't include her, etc).

# Details

About the battle:
> Countless spears are thrust toward him.
> Countless blades slash him.
> The revenants have been consumed by their hatred and despair for too long. They need a living sacrifice to pay the debt they owe to the Dead.
> Yet Sindersfell was never meant to exist. It doesn't belong to the Living or the Dead.
> The lightblade that once protected the Kingdom has transformed into the darkblade that slays the Dead.
> Before its collapse, he entrusted the [[Protocore]] to me along with Philos's last chance of survival.
> From that moment, I was the only person who could access the divergence point and return to Philos.
> Yet he would remain trapped within this madness in eternity's embrace. Until the Apocalypse arrives.
> The massive sword roars as it slashes and cuts. It impales one revenant soldier after another as they lunge toward him.
> However, the revenants slowly realize the blade that once struck fear into them can no longer reduce them to ashes.
> Silence lasts for a moment. Then, they erupt into a frenzy.
> That sword is no longer the arbiter of death. They cannot be destroyed. There's no need to be afraid.
> They celebrate. They howl. They surge like a wave toward the lone figure who still stands with a sword.

Of their resonance and the lightblade:
> As our paths intersect, I lean down and grasp his wrist. I pull him up behind me in one swift motion.
> I'm the one holding his hand this time. As our powers resonate, light swiftly coalesces and forms into a blade.
> Streams of light wind along the back of the blade. Power surges and boils between our palms.
> Before the revenants can lunge toward us, I grab his hand. Together, we raise the sword once more.
> The two swords of the stars were always meant to point in the same direction.

After the revenants are all defeated:
> *Shadowbind, who's beneath me, vanishes. As I'm about to fall onto the sharp spears below, a hand grabs me.*
> Xavier: ...
> MC: ...Xavier!
> *The radiance of the sun and the moon emanates from his body. Yet the heavy blade in his hand can no longer be lifted.*
> *The world falls into silence. Only he and I remain.*
> *He kneels beside me. He silently looks at me.*
> Xavier: ...\<Name>.
> *He opens his mouth as if he's trying to speak. But he can't utter a single word. I realize it's the first time he said my name since I arrived in this world.*
> Xavier: ...It's been a long time.
> *He wipes away the tears from the corner of my eye. Yet more replace them at a quickening rate.*
> *I don't understand how he can laugh while saying those words.*
> *The most important person in my life left me for a faraway place. I thought he would never return.*
> *The days we spent apart grew longer than the days we stood side by side.*
> Xavier: Was this your choice?
> I shake my head. Then I nod. He doesn't actually know my decision.
> Xavier: ...Good. The choice you made must be the best one.
> *Lumenflora petals mingle with ashes and float into the sky dyed by twilight. Our story is coming to an end.*


On the true nature of eternity, in Knight Xavier's flashback, he says:
> ...In Philos's oldest historical records, "eternity" doesn't refer to one's lifespan, but rather the stories of humanity.
> These tales are told by both the Living and the Dead.
> The Living gather the embers left by those who have passed away. The footsteps of the Dead echo in the dust.
> Their stories shall be recited by poets and told by travelers around a campfire.
> When their names are spoken once more...
> Only then will their unfulfilled ambitions, unexpressed love, and unsolved mysteries transform into stories that are passed down for generations. And to endure the test of time can be seen as a divine miracle
> "Eternity" has always been about stories that can immortalize humanity's joys and sorrows.

Back in MC's POV:
> As soon as I let go of his hand, the world is released from some kind of constraint. Everything begins to move backward.
> My consciousness is plunged once more into that familiar darkness.
> But a beam of warm light gently lifts my body.
> In the rapidly flowing river of time, I witness many miracles I've never seen before. A tree learns to stand again from the scorched earth. A bird breaks free from the mud and takes flight.
> All the wilted flowers with faded colors return to the hands of knights rushing to meet their beloved.
> Tiny life regrows in the magnificent tapestry of fate. Time radiates outward with countless pathways leading back to the past.
> Until everything slows down once more. At the very last moment, I hear a gentle voice speak.
> Tree: ...Thank you for choosing him.


Of the [[Traceback II]] mission:
> Stars sweep past the window one by one.
> During a long voyage, most interstellar travelers choose to enter [[Slepen Pod]]s Only one does not.
> Although there are countless moments of lightning streaking across stardust, he sits alone in the cockpit. His thoughts are indiscernible.
> When passing a beautiful a-star cluster, he doesn't look back. When passing a star that's about to be born, he doesn't look back.
> When passing the floating, faintly glowing dust in the cosmos, he still doesn't look back.
> The spacecraft finally passes through the long, seemingly endless [[Deepspace Tunnel]] that's akin to a river that flows forever. It carries him to an unknown destination.
> But in the universe where time still has an end, he must've gone to where I am.
