First seen by [[MC]] in the [[N109 Zone]] in [[02-02.04 The First Deal]] and [[02-02.05 Nightmare Finale]]. Via a crystal sample, [[MC]] and [[Zayne]] are able to connect this to the [[black crystals]] that appear on the patient at [[Chansia Hospital]] during [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon]].

[[Kevi]] also displays crystals like this starting in [[04-01.06 Veiled Sanctuary]].

In [[04-01.07 Unexpected]], MC specifically states that she and [[Zayne]] came to the conclusion that [[Aether Core]] exposure alone isn't enough to cause the crystals, and that somebody specifically created this "crystal-related disease" with the intention (or, at least, consequence) of turning people into monsters.
