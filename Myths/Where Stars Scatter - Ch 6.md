# Summary
MC awakes next to the river, sleeves soaked. She looks for Xavier and finds him sleeping in a nearby field of flowers, wreathed in corrosive black mist. He eventually wakes, recounting a "long dream" following the events of his departure from [[Philos]] with the [[Traceback II]] (see also [[Shooting Stars]]) and his eventual return to find her missing.

Believing himself to still be dreaming, [[Xavier]] asks a few questions plainly--if she had feelings for someone the last time he saw her (ironically, those feelings were for him), then where was that person when she was in danger? (Off on the [[Traceback II]] mission.) He wonders if he should have been more direct, then pulls a bewildered MC somewhat forcefully into a kiss.

In the next chapter, it's revealed that [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] remembers none of this exchange.

## Commentary
### Dramatic Irony
Recounting his dream, Xavier says:
> "When we last saw each other, you said you had feelings for someone. It doesn't matter to me, yet... Why wasn't that person by your side when you were in danger?"

This is a reference to the end of [[Shooting Stars]], when [[Queen MC]] still thinks [[Xavier]] is in love with the girl who gave him the [[star tassel]] (actually herself in a previous life) and she makes veiled comments about liking Xavier, which he also mistakes as being about someone else. ( #todo double check this and add the specific reference.)

So, his statement here is incredibly ironic, because *he* is the person she had feelings for, and *he* is the one that left her and wasn't by her side when she was in danger. Xavier's avoidance once again proves to be one of his most impactful flaws.

### Timeline differences
Based on the same quote as above, it seems that this version of [[Xavier]] never saw [[MC]] on earth, and so returned to [[Philos]]. By contrast, some of Xavier's memories in the main story continuity (especially his first birthday card #todo confirm this) show him committing to stay on Earth now that he's met MC. [[Xavier's Trailer]] says that it's his 214th summer on Earth and will be his last, but this is right before he re-meets MC in this timeline. It's possible that when he saved her as [[Lumiere]] during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], he didn't recognize her.

This, plus the lore on MC's origins ([[MC#Origins]]) revealed in Death and Rebirth could imply that there's a version of the timeline where [[Ever]] never summons [[MC]] (or succeeds in destroying her) and this would be the version where he returns to Philos.
 
# Details
When Xavier recounts his "long dream," he covers some key details of his departure in [[Shooting Stars]] and the version of the timeline where he returns to [[Philos]] to find [[Queen MC]] missing.

> Xavier: I had an incredibly long dream. I followed my teacher into battle. And then, I journeyed through the starry sea. When I returned, you were gone.
> *His voice is soft and hoarse. It still carries traces of that dreamlike daze.*
> Xavier: So much happened during those 300 years in your absence. I don't even know where to begin. I doubt you want to hear those boring details. Do you remember our little planet? I told you about it before. The wavyleaf sea lavenders \[sic] (([[forget-me-nots]])) grow better there. I brought back some seeds and hoped I could grow them for you.
* ((See also: [[Xavier and MC's little planet]]))

> MC: (So the name of that flower is... Wavyleaf sea lavender?)
> *My hand trembles, and I feel a sharp pain. The brooch on his chest has pricked my fingertip.*
> Xavier: Back then, it was just like this. I thought my intentions were clear. Why didn't you understand them? Maybe I'm the one who's foolish. I should have been more direct from the beginning.
> *He gently holds my finger and carefully wipes away the drop of blood.*
> Xavier: When we last saw each other, you said you had feelings for someone. It doesn't matter to me, yet... Why wasn't that person by your side when you were in danger?
> MC: ...
> Xavier: Forget him.
> *His persistent gaze stays on me for a long time. I can only nod in response.*
> MC: I don't like him anymore. ...But I like you. Is that all right?
> *As those words hang in the air, everything suddenly falls silent. Even the wind stops blowing.*
> *The night is still, and the flower field is silent. Only the distant waters of the river laps against the shore.*
> *Neither of us moves, and I'm trying to think of words that could break the tension. Then, he shifts closer to me.*
> MC: ...!
> *His cool fingertips press against my jawline, and our breaths intertwine. I attempt to create some distance between us.*
> Xavier: What's wrong? Am I not allowed to kiss you here?
> *He lowers his head, his expression indiscernible. All I can feel is his cool breath against my eyelashes.*
> Xavier: Ah, of course... Why would you want to see me like this?
> *The hand at my nape suddenly tightens its grip, and he lowers his head again.*
> *Instead of retreating, he stubbornly kisses me.*
> *It feels like I'm trapped in a thick, viscous dream. I'm unable to wake up and unwilling to try.*
> *The warmth and pressure from his hand seep into my skin. They carry an affection that borders on obsession.*
> Xavier: This is my dream. I'm free to do as l please... You're... a figment of my imagination, aren't you?
> *As our lips touch, I catch a glimpse of the Lumenflora gently swaying. The wind has begun to stir again.*
