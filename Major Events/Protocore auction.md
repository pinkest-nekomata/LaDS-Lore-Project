A key event in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]]. Occurs in [[02-02 Breakthrough]].
* Takes place at the [[Solon Hotel]] ([[02-02.01 Alone]])
* [[Sylus]] wasn't involved in planning it, rather, [[Sherman]]'s in charge ([[02-02.01 Alone]])
* [[Xavier]] suggests the purpose of the auction is because "[[Lumiere]]" (ie him) destroyed a bunch of [[Onychinus]]'s [[Protocore]]s and they need to make back money to pay their "partners".
