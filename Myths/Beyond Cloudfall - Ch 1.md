de# Summary
[[Sorceress MC]] has been sentenced to death by the [[Sacred Judicator]], cast into the [[Abyss]] which is full of fire and [[Wanderer]]. She runs for her life. As the [[Wanderer]]s descend, the dragon trapped there stops time and tells her that if she pulls out the sword, he'll save her life.

She does so, and the sword becomes golden light that pours into her--along with a red-black tendril of darkness (a piece of the dragon's soul). Thus, the Fiend is unleashed from the [[Abyss]].

He flies her to the [[black chapel]], and attempts to reclaim the piece of his soul. This drags hers out too, nearly killing her in the process--but she refuses, and takes her power back. He uses his eye (See also [[Sylus's Eye]]) and she covets its power.

Trying to think of a way to escape the dragon, she demands to be taken back to the [[Sanctuary]] in the [[Ivory City]] for revenge.

## Commentary

### Chapel Altar
Sylus's attempts to pull the fragment of his soul back from MC take place upon the chapel's altar. This is a lovely subversion and aligns with the story's themes of heresy.

### Translation notes
Below, "MTL" = Machine Translation via Google Translate

* The word localized to "sorceress" is more commonly translated as "witch"--"sorceress" carries a connotation of more power and dignity in EN, which is thematically appropriate
* The word localized to "fiend" is more commonly translated as "demon", which has different connotations in English. "Fiend", being less commonly used in English, lacks as much of a direct connection to Christian mythology for most EN speakers as "demon" has. Readers familiar with CN/JP/KN "demon" tropes can confidently connect Sylus to these.

> Once, on the day that I lost everything... I met my dragon.

The background shows a cave with fires burning along the floor. In the distance, past the mouth, spires of mountains or civilization stand in the mist.

> `MC runs`
> Arbiter: The Sorceress has been judged! Greed and evil shall perish so long as [[His Majesty]] and the [[Sacred Judicator]] protect [[Philos]] for all eternity! (Repeated twice)
> `MC collapses, vision darkening a moment`
> *Scarlet raindrops enter my eyes, while far below, they gather into a gurgling stream at the depths of the Abyss. Through my blurry vision, I can catch a flash of lightning ripping through Philos's gloomy night sky.*
> MC: (I can't die here...)
> *From my periphery to the area in front of me, darkness spreads like an all-consuming ocean. The world descends as the [[Wanderer]]s' claws close in, their cold, eerie gling like the flash of Death's scythe.*
> MC: (I won't accept this...)
> *There's no escaping it now.*
> MC: (... I refuse to accept this!)
> Dragon: I like your eyes. They are beautiful... In them, I can see your hatred, defiance, and greed for life.
> *The wind ceases, and it feels like time is caught in an invisible grip. I close my eyes before struggling to open them again. A flash of white light streaks across an ancient rock wall. There I see the shadow of a massive beast with horns.*
> MC: (That's...!)
> *Chains bind its wings so tightly that, if not for the greatsword lodged in its chest, its massive form would almost merge with the rock wall.*
> Dragon: Make a deal with me. If you want to live, that is. Pull out the sword.
> MC: (The Fiend... actually exists...?)
> Dragon: You don't have time for questions.
> *In the next instant, the stilled air starts to move again, and a rancid wind howls as the once-frozen Wanderers leap towards me.*
> *Driven by defiance and fury, I raise my hands and grip the rusted sword.*
> MC: I want to live...
> `MC pulls out the sword.`
> MC: No matter... the cost!
> *When I pull out the sword, the rust melts away and transforms into light. It surges into my body, mingling with a strand of black-red mist.*
> *Amidst the chaos, wings flap and stir up a whirlwind of sand and gravel. I'm thrown onto the jagged rocks, my vision growing hazier by the second. All I can see in the darkness is a single, dark-red, gem-like eye.*

On-screen text:
> Enormous wings cut across the land, casting shadows like the end of days over every city in [[Philos]]. On that day, the girl marked for execution unleashed the Fiend from the Abyss.

> This was long before humans arrived on this planet.
* MTL: That was before humans became the masters of this planet.

> Thousands of years ago, dragons ruled over the lands of Philos.
* MTL: Tens of thousands of years ago, dragons roamed the land of Philos*

> By nature, dragons are wicked creatures that feed on human souls. They excel at drawing out the darkest parts of a person's heart, driving humans to turn on one another and become slaves to their desires. The greedier the soul, the more irresistible it is to a dragon.
> Seen as the embodiment of evil, dragons were a harbinger of the world's end--wherever they appeared, Doomsday followed.
> That was until the last dragon on the planet was sealed in the bottom of the Abyss over 1,600 years ago.
> Doomsday faded into a forgotten myth, and the age of humanity finally began.

> *I feel as though my chest is being ripped open. An overwhelming weight presses down on my body. I'm immobilized.
> `Background changes to the interior of the Onyx Chapel`  ([[black chapel]])
> The towering black building looms, its top swallowed by darkness. A scaly beast's claw firmly pins me down to the central platform.*
> MC: (What's happening... I can't move...)
> *I look down to see strands of faint [[golden light]] being pulled from my body by an invisible force.*
> MC: (It hurts...)
> *I struggle to turn my head. Once again, the shadow of a dragon's horns and wings are flickering on the wall where firelight dances. Clarity strikes me, and I cry out in pain.*
> MC: Stop it...! Our deal... I would be kept alive!
* MTL: Stop it...! Our deal... was to let me live!
> *The fiendish shadow lowers its head, and its voice pierces my mind.*
> Dragon: To be a dead person walking counts as being alive.
* ((In context, he is draining her soul, which would leave her a husk. His point is that even if her soul is dead, as long as her body lives/breathes, she's technically 'alive'.))
> MC: Stop! No!
> *In between life and death, an uncontrollable tremor erupts from deep within my soul. A phantom greatsword forms in my hand. It plunges into the beast's chest.*
> *The dragon's pained cry resounds in the hall, and the weight on my body vanishes. Clutching my chest, I quickly sit up.
> As my breathing steadies, I realize I haven't been torn open like I thought.*
> Dragon: I vividly recall you saying 'No matter the cost.'
> `Footsteps. Dragon Sylus appears.`
> *The giant beast's shadow fades away, and from the darkness emerges a man wrapped in a blood-red mist. He watches me like I'm his prey. And similar to the dragon, he possesses a pair of beautiful, garnet-like eyes.*
> MC: ...I set you free, and you saved me. That means our deal in the Abyss is done.
> *He slowly approaches me. I quickly stumble as I make my way down the platform. I can barely keep my distance from him.*
> MC: Dragons can only feed on human souls if they're offered up willingly. So... as long as I don't agree, you can't eat me.
> *The Fiend narrows his eyes and approaches me from the other side of the platform.*
> Dragon: Is that it? Instead of claiming your lackluster soul... You need to return what doesn't belong to you.
> *The dragon curls a finger. [[Golden light]] is once again pulled from my chest.*
> MC: You... Stop...!
> *But the more I struggle, the clearer it becomes--a strange, unsettling black mist is tangled up within me. It feels like a soul that isn't mine has somehow fused with my own.*
> Dragon: It's not that unbearable, is it? Having your soul torn apart and all.
* ((Notably, we can infer that he's just experienced this when the removal of the sword caused a bit of his soul to go with it.))
> *The dragon suddenly yanks me across the platform, its blood-red right eye just inches from my face. In a flash, my mind is dragged into an abyssal vortex. Just when I think I'm about to be devoured--*
> `Background becomes a valley.`
> *The wind howls through the crimson valley as countless soldiers of the [[Legion of Justitia]] thrust their weapons at my chest.
> I quickly realize this isn't my past, and the body writing in pain isn't mine either. This is the dragon's memory.
> I gather my strength, tense up, trying to break free from the memory. The valley and wind fade away like weathered paint.
> `Returns to the chapel and Sylus' dragon form.`
> *Traces of light swiftly flow back into my chest. It even pulls the Fiend to me.*
> Dragon: ...!
> *He covers his right eye with his hand and leans over the platform.*
> Dragon: Your power... What is its source? `(Demanding, accusatory.)`
> MC: (My power...)
> *That's a question even I can't answer. Before I can think further, a claw-like hand grabs my chin and pulls me closer.*
> Dragon: Look at me.
* ((Directly echoed in [[02-01.02 Alike]]))
> *Cold sweat blurs my vision as his grip around my neck tightens. I can't help but meet his gaze. A familiar voice resounds in my mind. It's unmistakably mine, yet the tone is strangely foreign.*
> MC: (His eye... I want that eye... It's mine... It belongs to me...)
> Dragon: `(Hungrily)` It's getting stronger... The scent of desire... Tell me your desire and offer your soul to me. Then I shall promise to give you a painless death. Unless... you wish to become a minion of a dragon's nest.
> *I grip my hand so tight it nearly draws blood, but how could anyone sell their soul to the Fiend?*
> MC: I... I don't want anything.
> Dragon: You fool.
> *His fingers brush over my lip that I bit earlier. There's a tingling sensation, and his right eye gleams with a faint blood-red light.*
> MC: (I can't... breathe... No... I need to come up with something... Anything! So long as it lets me survive...!)
> *Countless fleeting thoughts that could barely serve as "excuses" flash in my mind. I only managed to grasp one.*
> MC: Take... Take me back to the [[Ivory City]]. I must return...!
> Dragon: Your life is hanging by a thread, mortal. And yet you still dare to play tricks.
> MC: ...I'm being honest! I used to live in the [[Sanctuary]], but they judged me as a sorceress and threw me into the [[Abyss]]. I won't accept this... I want revenge!
> *My heart pounds in my chest, and my hand trembles as I reach for my dagger. Suddenly, the restraints on me disappear. I'm forcefully flung back to the platform.*
> `The dragon scoffs.`
> *The dark mist skims along the smooth surface of the platform, retreating into his palm. As it does, my wounds close up, leaving no scars behind. It's almost unreal.*
> Dragon: Lead the way.
