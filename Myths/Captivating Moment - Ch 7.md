# Summary
A brief [[Sylus]] POV reveals that they left for the [[small country in the south]] early, and Sylus is happy to see MC boldly asserting herself into his life, which simultaneously shocks [[Luke and Kieran]]. They speak briefly about a meeting with [[General Rowan]] that night. ((Presumably, the reason for leaving early.))

After boxing, MC showers and then finds Sylus in the kitchen. This is the kindled scene from [[Captivating Flavor]]. They banter as Sylus makes salad, then go to sit together on the terrace, looking down over a lively market.

MC reveals she's been wanting to vacation here, and Sylus reminds her that she's not trapped. She says her top priority is the [[Wanderer]] activity, which prompts him to ask why she hasn't started on that yet. She replies that they'd agreed to spend three days together for him to show her his life, and she's not going to go back on her word just because she got what she wanted.

They banter about mutually using each other, and Sylus reveals he has plans for her at tonight's meeting, giving her the [[Harrier 700]] pistol.

## Commentary

### Evolving pretenses
Not quite willing to admit to the other that they want to spend time together, [[MC]] and [[Sylus]] lean into various pretenses. MC says she doesn't want to go back on her word to spend three days proving herself, while Sylus says he doesn't mind her using him--and he has a use in mind for her as well.

So, finding a win-win solution for their other goals currently provides a pretense for why they want to spend time together.

# Details
They head out to the [[small country in the south]] earlier than expected.

> Sylus took the girl straight to the airport.
> He left earlier than planned. And while the girl was confused, she didn't question him. He likes that.
> The jet landed at their destination, and the girl effortlessly found his private boxing ring in the hotel they're staying in.
> The sound of punches hitting a punching bag echoes from the end of the hallway.
> As Sylus listens to the report, he heads to the boxing ring.
> Luke: Boss, [[General Rowan]] asked to meet up tomorrow.
> Kieran: Wait, who has the guts to enter Boss's boxing ring?
> Luke: ...Are you stupid?
> *At the entrance to the boxing ring, Sylus watches the girl as she delivers swift punches. He smiles.*
> *Luke and Kieran stare in disbelief at Sylus, who's grinning.*
> Sylus: The [[Harrier 700]] should be a good fit for her... Kieran, get a gun. And Luke, inform the General I'm only meeting them tonight.

After exercising, MC showers. When she emerges, she finds Sylus in the kitchen humming and peeling an apple.

This is the Kindled scene of [[Captivating Flavor]].

Sylus is preparing a salad. MC approaches, and thinking she hasn't been noticed yet, she goes for a sneak attack. He says the chef called in sick, so "we're on our own". He tells her to choose from three jars of dressing on the counter, and he dips a finger in to taste.

* Orange: It's sour...? This one's not bad... We should use more of this next time...
* Red: #todo
* Green: #todo

MC asks how she's going to eat from it if he already stuck his fingers in, and he cheekily replies, "Who said it's for you?" Aiming for revenge, she dips her finger in another sauce on the counter and tries to smear it on his face. He easily catches her wrist, saying "Too slow" and steers it back to her for her to taste.

She says she's bored and will leave now, telling him not to follow. But he's already heading to the terrace (implied to be the direction she was going) and tells her to just thinking of as him "passing by". They eat on the terrace together.

From there they can see a vibrant local market (see also [[small country in the south]]) and MC expresses how she's long wished to vacation here. Sylus reminds her that she's free to leave whenever she wants, but she insists that her priority is dealing with the [[Protofield]] anomaly and dramatic increase in [[Wanderer]]s.

> Sylus takes a sip of his red wine.
> Sylus: So why haven't you started your business already? Haven't you used me to get what you wanted?
> MC: While you did leave early, we agreed to spend three days together so I could see your life. I don't want you to think I'm going back on my word once l've achieved my goal.
> Sylus: What do you plan to do now?
> MC: I'll familiarize myself with the city. If you finish your business and head back, it's fine. I can stay and do my investigation. I can stay here until there's a commercial flight.
> *A coin suddenly appears between Sylus's fingers. It's quickly flipped.*
> Sylus: When you're alone in a foreign country, you should make the most of what's around you. For example, you should confidently ask me to wait for you. So we can return together.
> MC: You're a busy man. I don't want to waste your time.
> Sylus: Sweetie, when you're using me, you don't need to feel like you're a liability. I don't mind being used by you. After all, I want to use you too.
> *Confused, I look at Sylus. With a smile, he places a pistol on the dining table.*
> Sylus: The [[Harrier 700]]. If you want to keep up with me, you need a good weapon. If you're done eating, let's go.
> MC: Will tonight... be dangerous?
> Sylus: Are you scared?
> *Sylus stares at me as I pick up the weapon from the table. I attach it to my waist.*
> MC: I wouldn't be a hunter if I was afraid of danger.
> *Sylus slightly smiles.*
> Sylus: Here's to our mutual use of each other. Let it be a pleasant experience.
