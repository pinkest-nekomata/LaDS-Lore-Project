The celestial body alpha-P0159 was discovered via the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. It's speculated to be the core of a star. While this core no longer reacts to energy, research suggests that traces of life may very well exist within its galaxy.
Using the most vibrant colors of Deepspace, the galaxy where alpha-P0159 resides responded to humanity's lifelong vision of the universe. This, it was named Philos, a word meaning "love".
