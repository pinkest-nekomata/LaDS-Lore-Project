# Summary
[[Xavier]] ends up going up to the front instead of [[MC]] and gives an accurate summary of the traversable wormhole. ((From a meta level, this is a chance for the writers to suggest some real-world inspiration for the [[Deepspace Tunnel]].))

After class, it's revealed that [[Xavier]] and [[Ulysses]] are old friends. The discussion reveals that the [[Wanderer]] responsible for the attacks is able to stealth itself, and may have been modified. Ulysses suggests that the university's [[RMFMA]] device may have captured its signal. Together, the three head over.

## Commentary
The description of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] as a wormhole is probably more thematic than consequential, but it's a neat opportunity for the writers to point at some real-world inspiration. It's also a specific confirmation that time travel is possible in-universe, which is a key part of Xavier's backstory.
 
# Details
When MC looks stunned to be called on, [[Ulysses]] switches to calling on "your friend". (([[Xavier]] and [[Ulysses]] are already friends, so Ulysses is teasing them a bit.))

Xavier sighs, then confidently walks up to the podium. The classroom lights dim, then a holographic projection of the universe appears.
> Xavier: In theory, the Morris-Thorne wormhole is a traversable wormhole. It is spherically symmetrical and features a "throat" that bridges two black holes. The "throat" is a finite spherical region, containing negative energy density matter to counteract gravitational forces inside the wormhole...
> *As Xavier speaks in a measured tone, the stars shift under his touch to gradually form a wormhole model. The lights from distant planets flicker before us, and his silhouette seemingly stretches across light years. For a moment I wonder... was Xavier like this back in college?*
> Dr Ulysses: Correct. The negative energy's repulsive gravitational properties keep the wormhole's throat open, allowing matter or signals to pass through. Time travel becomes possible with this model. For example, the Deepspace Tunnel above us might very well be a giant wormhole. The mysterious Deepspace signals could then make their way to our distant Earth. Perhaps certain materials or even other forms of live can find us through these cosmic channels...

Xavier returns to his seat, and MC asks whether he was really an astronomy student.
> Xavier: Who knows. I have too many diplomas at home. I need to check first.
* ((As revealed in [[Passing By]] and [[WU-04 From The Stars]], [[Xavier]] has led many lives on Earth since he arrived 214 years ago.))

After class, [[MC]] approaches Dr [[Ulysses]] to ask about the students, when he greets [[Xavier]] and it's revealed that they're friends. Xavier introduces him as an assistant professor, but Ulysses corrects him that he was promoted to associate professor two years ago. Ulysses correctly guesses he's there on a mission, and half-jokingly asks if he should expect a major incident to occur.

MC takes the chance to ask about the [[Wanderer]] attacks. Ulysses confirms that when he was in the lab preparing for a meeting, he heard a scream outside the room, but then couldn't find anything. Xavier asks if the [[Flux Stablizer]] detected anything, and since it didn't, that means the [[Wanderer]] is capable of stealth, which narrows the possibilities significantly. Xavier also suggests the [[Wanderer]] could be modified.

Ulysses suggests that the research center's [[RMFMA]], which is more sensitive than the [[Flux Stablizer]], might have caught the Wanderer's signal. Xavier thought the device was too far away, but it was moved closer into campus a few years ago. MC asks if they can use it, and Ulysses says they can, as long as they have the clearance. MC expects this rules them out, but Xavier says "Let's go" and asks Ulysses to lead the way.
