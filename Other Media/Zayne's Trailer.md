On-screen text:
> 12:17 A.M. - Akso Hospital's Original Location
> 24 hours prior to the area being completely frozen

A cardiac monitor beeps in the background. [[Zayne]] types on a laptop, while the following text appears:
> The donor's heart works well. Cardiac Output: 5.2 L/min
> [[Protocore]] implant surgery will begin in 3 hours

Zayne walks down a hallway, then enters a room and closes the door behind him. A newton's cradle rocks on a desk.

Zayne clutches his right arm with his left. Frost spreads down his wrist. ((This is how Zayne losing control of his Evol is consistently depicted.))

Voiceover:
> Man 1: (calm) Are you sure about this?
> Woman 1: (calm) Won't you regret it? Is she the one?
> Man 2: (calm) She will not come back.
> Man 3: (urgent) You will pay the price!
> Woman 2: (Mournful) You've paid the price...

Frost crawls up his neck.

Voiceover:
> Zayne: When you and the world wake up... I hope we do not meet again.

# Commentary
The application of [[Protocore]]s to heart surgery was [[Zayne's research]] when he was in university. He ended up halting this research and destroying his data due to the appearance of [[black crystals]] on a patient's heart. ([[WU-01 Longly Flame]])

The voiceover about hoping he doesn't see MC again likely relates to when he lost control over his Evol and almost killed her. (See also [[WU-01 Longly Flame]] and [[Never-Ending Winter]], as well as [[Zayne losing control of his Evol]].)

#todo do we get any other info about the original location of [[Akso Hospital]]? This reference is new to me and I want to dig into more.
