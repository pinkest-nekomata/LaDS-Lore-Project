# Spacepedia
The Reflective Metaflux Field Monitor and Analyzer (RMFMA) is more sensitive than standard stabilizers, and capable of detecting even the slightest [[Protofield]] fluctuations.
Fewer than ten exist worldwide, one of which is housed at the [[Prestara University Deepspace Exploration Research Center]].

# Other Info
* It can also detect [[fluctuation]]s from the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] itself.
