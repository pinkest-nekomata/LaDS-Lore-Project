**Description**
> Due to work, I had to disguise myself as a leader of Tenebra group and infiltrate their ranks to gather information. Anxious about the possibility of my cover being exposed, I asked Sylus for a special lesson...

# Summary
[[MC]] meets with [[Sylus]] so he can give her a lesson in being a qualified leader for an undercover mission. Kieran arranges some challenges and experiences, and they stop by a restaurant. Two drunkards who aren't part of Kieran's plan walk up, giving MC a chance to fend for herself. When they see Sylus's face, they quickly make themselves scarce.

Then, they head to a high-end mall near the [[N109 Zone]]. He helps her pick out a pair of luxury sunglasses so she can use them to hide and be more intimidating.

# Key Info
* Sylus's "rules" for MC are:
	* Don't be quick to question things.
	* Talk less.
* Sylus challenges MC to "scare" him with a single look (like how he scared off the thugs) and she grabs his collar and yanks him down, resulting in a heated moment.

# Trivia
* MC's first reaction when she sees the price tags on the sunglasses is how much ammo she could buy for that amount.
