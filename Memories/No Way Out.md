**Description**
> One day after a mission ended, I suddenly received a distress signal from a civilian. Upon reaching the indicated coordinates, I was astonished to discover that the person in need was actually Sylus...

# Summary
MC receives a distress call, but finds Sylus waiting for her. He's injured, and claims the bright sun is the reason he's still bleeding. They head to a motel, where MC helps Sylus bandage his wounds.

They discuss what it will take to better understand each other's worlds, and Sylus invites MC over the boundary between light and shadow. There's a tense yet tender moment where she buttons his shirt. Once night falls, Sylus says it's time to go and beckons to her.

# Key Info
* Sylus isn't always able to instantly heal his wounds. He claims the reason he's still bleeding is that the sun is too bright.
* Sylus is willing to ask MC for help when he's genuinely injured.
* Initially, Sylus does lie and minimize about what he's been up to, initially claiming he had an encounter with a Wanderer when in reality it's a gunshot wound.
* Sylus notes that MC is skilled at bandaging wounds.
* The motel they stay at was created by a man who came from the N109 zone. He made a deal with Sylus to ensure that his son would have a normal life, and it's just a regular motel.
	* Sylus even knows the boy's love for mobile games is interfering with his grades on his finals.

# Trivia
* Sylus often fidgets with a coin.
* At the motel in Linkon, Sylus requests room 503.
	* This motel doesn't question his injured state, and the boy at the counter offers him a first aid kit.
	* MC suspects this is a safe house of his.
* Sylus asks MC to turn away when he digs the bullet fragments out of his arm so she doesn't have "nightmares" of him.

# Quotes

> MC: You always cause trouble, but you're never honest about it.
> Sylus:If you'd like to keep your involvement with the N109 Zone to a minimum, then you shouldn't care too much.
> MC: Me:But I thought you liked my "excessive" concern.

> Sylus: Turn around.
> MC: Huh?
> Sylus: You don't need to see this. I'd rather not give you nightmares about me.

> Sylus: You're skilled. I thought you were the type who usually comes out unscathed.
> MC: But because you keep messing around, all of my time lately has been spent on you. I don't often get to take on very difficult missions. My marksmanship skills are getting rusty.
> Sylus: I see you're not exactly pleased. I'll find a few dangerous Wanderers for you to use as training dummies later.

> *His breath trembles slightly. He's not pretending this time. I try to be more gentle. Whenever the alcohol swabs touch him, my heart skips a beat.*
> *Maybe I'm being too careful since Sylus starts to tease me.*
> Sylus: Your tender loving care is going to last the whole night, huh.
> Me: Why don't you just instantly recover and head back to the N109 Zone to wreak havoc then?
> Sylus: ... `(pained laugh)`

> *Sylus doesn't reply and just continues resting on my shoulder. I start to feel bad.*
> MC: Be honest with me... Why are you doing all of this? Do you really not care about your own safety?
> Sylus smiles. His breath carries something heavy, but he still appears carefree.
> Sylus: There are shadows even in the places where the sun doesn't shine. And it just so happens I'm a person who likes to live in the dark. If you're curious about my world, you'll have to step beyond the border between light and shadow. You must be the one to make that decision.
> *I finish bandaging his wound.*
> MC: I'm stunned. You're acting like you're giving me a choice.
> *Sylus sits up but doesn't put any distance between us. He just looks at me with keen interest.*
> *I want to avoid his gaze, but he suddenly lifts my chin. He slightly smiles, as if enjoying the sight of my eyes trying to dart away.*
> Sylus: Of course. I did give you a choice. And it's precisely because you've never chosen something that surprised me.

> Sylus: Once I make a promise, I never go back on my word.

> Sylus: Not everyone is born with the privilege of being a normal person. You've known this for a while.
