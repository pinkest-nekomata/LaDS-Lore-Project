# Details
MC has a flashback to when she first gifted [[Caleb's necklace]].

Based on the dialogue, this is when Caleb is first leaving for the [[Aerospace Academy]].

MC is sad to see him go, asking what she'll do if she suddenly craves his [[braised chicken wings]]. Grandma assures MC that [[Caleb]] will be back for the holidays, and [[Grandma]] will make him cook every day.

Caleb catches MC trying to be sneaky about a send-off gift, and takes it from her with his gravity manipulation [[Evol]].

Caleb asks her to put it on for him:

Caleb: I knew it'd be in a style you realy like. Won't you put it on for me?
MC: No way. Don't you have hands?
Caleb: Nooo, I don't. Hurry, the train is about to leave.
MC: (Taking the necklace to put it on him.) Hmph... If I see it's not with you next time, you'll be sorry.
