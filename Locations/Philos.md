# Spacepedia
The celestial body alpha-P0159 was discovered via the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. It's speculated to be the core of a star. While this core no longer reacts to energy, research suggests that traces of life may very well exist within its galaxy.
Using the most vibrant colors of Deepspace, the galaxy where alpha-P0159 resides responded to humanity's lifelong vision of the universe. This, it was named Philos, a word meaning "love".

((Note: CN has only one word to mean both "star" and "planet", so the phrasing here does *not* necessarily mean that the celestial body is the core of a star--see also [[celestial bodies in CN]]. From context, it's a planetary core. Also, what is translated as "galaxy" here could also be "star system".))

# Planetary Core
[[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]] indicates that Philos's [[Sterre Energy]] has been depleted, which is consistent with the idea that "this core no longer reacts to energy".

[[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]] reveals that the [[Aether Core]]s are actually the cores of the various parallel versions of Earth/[[Philos]] in the [[branching timelines]]. These [[Aether Core]]s are also tied to [[MC]]'s existence as a cosmic entity, part of the fundamental fabric of the universe.

This is why/how MC can be "born from the planet's core" as noted in myths like [[Shooting Stars]] and [[Sea of Golden Sand]].
# Other Info
The first in-story reference to this celestial body is during [[01-08.02 Desecrated Soil]], where it's specifically referred to as a "planet". In EN, this contradicts Spacepedia, but in CN the word for "star" is the same as for "planet". 

Notably, the use of the Greek "Philos" for its name is identical in EN and CN.

# Love Themes
Abstractly, the planets represent both MC and the concept of "love", i.e. love stories, so the various "versions" of Philos can also be understood as all the different possible versions of love stories, which we get to see through the Myths. 

This interpretation is supported by the themes discussed in [[WU-12 Fractal Library Q&A]]:

[[WU-12 Fractal Library Q&A#02 Question 2]]:
> Perhaps all the things we consider impossible now and the mysteries we haven't observed really exist somewhere... Maybe in the future, or maybe in another universe. I choose to believe in the worlds that you can find in those stories.

[[WU-12 Fractal Library Q&A#04 Question 4]]:
> The universe isn't good or bad. It's simply a collection of stories following their own laws.


# Origin
[[05-02 All From Deepspace]], specifically [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]], confirms that Philos is a planet with many "different paths it could take."

In a sense, MC and [[Philos]] are one and the same.
> I am the cosmos.
> -- [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]]

Note also this passage from  [[05-02.04 Dust of Memories]]:
>  In the vast cosmos, my power has no starting point or destination. It appeared when the universe was created. It's a fundamental law etched into the fabric of existence.

So, this implies similarly that Earth/Philos doesn't have a distinct start/end, but rather experiences cycles of death and rebirth. (See also [[time loop]])

These planetary cycles can be understood as parallel realities, all the different "versions" the planets could take. [[05-02.07 When the Snow Falls]] specifically references these potential outcomes:
> And now this ever-changing, precarious world seems to face an unprecedented crisis.
> [[Protofield]] disturbances, climate anomalies... Some say Earth's climate system has broken down, and a disaster comparable to the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] is imminent.
> Others claim Earth is on the verge of collapse. All tectonic plates will shatter, and thus human civilization will end.
* Climate anomalies can create the snowy planet of [[Tower of Secrets]] or the endless desert of [[Sea of Golden Sand]].
* Another [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] type disaster could result in a world overrun by [[Abomination]]s as described in [[Still In Dark]].
* The shattering of the tectonic plates is what occurred in [[#Xavier's continuity]], described below.

# Versions
The main timeline occurs at the [[converging timelines]], meaning that the main story may discuss different versions of Earth/Philos together.

Sometimes, multiple myths refer to the same "version" of Philos in a shared continuity, such as how [[Tears of Romirro]] is a sequel to [[Forgotten Sea]]. Other times, they don't seem directly related even for the same LI, such as Zayne's [[Snow's Embrace]] Myth which seems to take place on historic earth, and [[Tower of Secrets]] which takes place on a version of [[Philos]] with a royal family and a [[Creatio Core]].

So far, the myths that seem to be set in historic Earth ([[Snow's Embrace]], [[Forgotten Sea]])

The most important versions of Philos (or the ones we now the most about) are described below.

## Summary
So far, the myths set in historic Earth and the main story timeline don't seem to be mutually exclusive--they could share the same "world" as each other and don't specifically mention [[Aether Core]]s. The Philos myths have more key differences, as noted below.

Note that [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]] hints that the Main Story timeline version of Earth is on the brink of destruction, and [[05-02.07 When the Snow Falls]] suggests the tectonic plates shattering as one potential outcome,

## Xavier's continuity
Since all of Xavier's myths so far are on the same continuity, and he explicitly traveled back in time to reach the main timeline, this is the version of Philos we know the most about.

In [[When Shooting Stars Fall]], we learn that Earth was remade as [[Philos]]. Its "extinguished core" was replaced with a "powerful, artificial one". 
* Notably, this also implies that Earth somehow moved across space and time into the newly discovered star system, since [[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]] confirms that the [[Philos]] that [[Xavier]] left behind is in another galaxy than Earth is currently.
	* ((Could this hint at [[Ever]]'s interest in the [[Spatium Core]] which can displace even very large objects through space? MC absorbs this core in [[05-01.01 New Objective]], and since she's directly tied to the planet itself, this could have broader impacts.))
	* Additionally, [[cosmic cinematic#End of Long Awaited Revelry]] contains the message "Destination is in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way--Once the home of humanity: Earth" reinforcing the displacement of the planet.
* Given the reveal in [[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]] that [[MC]]'s power is tied to the planetary cores, which are one and the same as [[Aether Core]]s, (and the theme of cores in [[Xianxia]] fiction), this should be interpreted a metaphysical/energetic core, and not the literal molten center of the planet.

As shown in [[cosmic cinematic#End of Long Awaited Revelry]], Earth literally broke apart into chunks separated by the vacuum of space. [[Academy MC]] refers to this as the "starry sea" in [[When Shooting Stars Fall#01 Distant Stars]]. Travel between these chunks, or "Plates", is difficult. It's the artificial core that prevents the Plates from drifting further apart--it literally holds the fragmented planet together. Clear skies are a rarity ([[When Shooting Stars Fall]]).

Known Plates:
* [[Academy]] Plate, a small one ([[When Shooting Stars Fall]])
### Power Source
#todo Key info in [[Shooting Stars]] here: [YT Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO9qTMvnts0&t=2078s)

[[WU-16 Utopian Roamer#Chaos and Rebirth]] contains additional hints:
> The [[Protofield]]'s energy signature differs completely from Earth's, showing striking similarities to Wanderer energy patterns instead... Could Wanderer interference be affecting my readings?

One potential interpretation is that the energy readings are actually due to [[Philos]]'s artificial core, which as noted above involves consuming human energy to sustain itself and results in the formation of Wanderers. It's another clue connecting the appearance of [[Wanderer]]s to properties of [[Philos]] itself.

### Timeline
* Year 0: Philos is born from Earth. ([[When Shooting Stars Fall]])
	* Philos is not in the same galaxy that Earth was. ([[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]])
	* Philosians are effectively immortal, unless they have specific health problems
* Year 214: [[Academy MC]] and [[Xavier]] meet
* Year 217: [[Academy MC]] dies
* Era: The Age of Immortality ([[Shooting Stars]])
	* This age can only be sustained by MC's repeated death in the planet's core.
	* The same king rules for much of this time. Xavier is prince, but he ends up leaving the role to [[Queen MC]]
	* [[Xavier's Trailer]] implies that Philos at some point gave up on immortality.
		* ((Additionally, it maybe was always something reserved only for a select few, but this was not known to [[Academy MC]]. The other plates could be left to their own devices.))
