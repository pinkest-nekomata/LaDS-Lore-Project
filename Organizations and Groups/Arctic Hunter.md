aka Polar Hunter
# Spacepedia
They are hunters under the [[Arctic Team]] of the [[Hunters Association]]. Unlike the agile [[Sky Hunter]]s who are lightly equipped, Arctic Hunters need to gear up to deal with extreme weather conditions. They are equipped with heavy protective suits to resist the cold, face masks, and goggles to ensure they can see in blizzards. The [[Evol Railgun]], with its large attach range, is also more suitable for combat in uninhabited areas.
