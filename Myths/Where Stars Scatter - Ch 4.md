# Summary
Back at the [[Order of Babel]] monastery MC speaks with the [[Bishop]] again about the [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] that will happen at the full moon, when they choose [[revenant]]s to journey the [[Sinders]] searching for the [[Tree of Life]]. He states a key theme of the myth: "Memories prove one's existence. Yet those who died here are trapped. They can never create new memories." (Previously MC had said that having no memories is the same as never having existed.)

At the [[Bishop]]'s invitation, MC explores their library and learns what happened to [[Philos]], confirming the direct link to the [[Shooting Stars]] myth timeline. [[Queen MC]] was almost scrubbed from history, and [[Xavier]] did end up taking the crown after her--and then became the "[[Tyrant]]" blamed for [[Philos]]'s downfall.

Xavier finds her at the library, referring to her as his "only important person", echoing her words from Ch 3. They discuss [[Philos]]'s history.

## Commentary

# Details

A key theme of the myth:
> Bishop: Memories prove one's existence. Yet those who died here are trapped. They can never create new memories.


In the library:
> For several days, I immersed myself in the sea of books. Although I found no records related to the Pilgrimage Ceremony, I learned what happened to Philos during my absence.
> In the beginning, the energy needed to extend the planet's lifespan was almost depleted. Beasts called Wanderers grew increasingly violent and occupied most of the planet.
> Even an immortal planet sustained with energy would fail to escape the fate of decline.

> After two hundred years of silence, a young woman with not a drop of royal blood ascended the throne.
> Under her rule, Philos reclaimed its former glory for a time. This period would later be called the "[[Morn Era]]."
> However, historical records about her are scarce. They've only managed to preserve the magnificent spectacle of her coronation.
> Her life and fate were seemingly erased by an invisible hand. There is nothing but a blank void.
* ((This is a direct reference to [[Queen MC]] and [[Shooting Stars]].))

> The situation in Philos grew increasingly dire as time passed.
> The royal family and citizens were split into several factions. Their constant disputes rendered the monarchy on the brink of collapse.
> Natural disasters raged while the fires of war burned without end. The flames of chaos swept across the land and destroyed the last vestiges of the old world order.
> The last monarch of [[Philos]] was an undefeated arbiter of judgment. Yet he was the [[Tyrant]] who supposedly led the Kingdom to its demise.

Later, MC adds that the first 200 years of Xavier's rein were the "[[Golden Epoch]]".

MC asks Xavier about the fate of the capital city, the [[Holy Sword of the Goddess]] (statue shattered), [[Astria Knyght Academy]] (burned), and the oaks behind the [[Starhunters]]' main building (burned).

From the library, MC offers the books "Philosian Guide: Caring for Flowers" (for the [[forget-me-nots]]) and "How to Identify Edible Mushrooms" (since he accidentally poisoned her before). She teases him for over-watering the flowers.
