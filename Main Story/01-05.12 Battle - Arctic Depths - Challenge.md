**Description**
> The sky is engulfed in dark clouds up above [[Mt Eternal]], with thunder and lightning putting on a show. Strangely enough, the meteorological center has not picked up any unusual weather readings. It is suspected that this phenomenon is connected to the presence of those massive [[Wanderer]]s. Hunters, it is time to head out and investigate with caution.
