# Spacepedia
An [[Aether Core]] capable of influencing space, even creating entirely new spaces.
Though originally shattered, it has reassembled, drawn together by some gravitational pull. (See also [[Complete Aether Core Structure]].)

# Power
[[MC]] absorbs this core in [[05-01.01 New Objective]] and [[Sylus]] is immediately able to sense its power when he next sees her in [[05-01.04 The Match]].

Throughout the rest of [[05 Death and Rebirth]], it allows her to sense the physical location of key powers.

# Origin
[[05-02.03 Cosmic Convergence]] reveals that the [[Aether Core]]s are the planetary cores of the various parallel versions of [[Philos]] in the [[branching timelines]].

One of the Spatium Core fragments is within the [[Tome of the Sea God]] ([[03-B Land of Secret Flames]]), hinting that this [[Aether Core]] may have something to do with [[Rafayel]]'s version(s) of [[Philos]]. The rest of the fragments are found already in the possession of [[Wanderer]]s.

# Other Info

## Conjecture
Given that the [[Spatium Core]] can move objects through space, and Earth has to move galaxies to become [[Philos]], and MC's existence is closely tied to the planet, it's possible that the Spatium Core's power will "move" Earth through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] to the [[Philos]] system.
