"We arrive at Raymond's mansion, and the ornate iron gate slowly opens. We're greeted by a desolate courtyard shrouded in eerie silence. The architectural style is of modern design and simplicity. A large pool surrounds it, the water's surface a blanket of blue-green algae." -- [[01-02.02 Close Encounter]]

Key features:
* [[Raymond's Lemurian skeleton]] in a waterless fish tank
* The collection room (which [[Raymond]] has been refusing to leave) is on the third floor.
