# Summary
Due to a [[high-ranking mole in the Association]], when [[MC]] is transporting the [[Spatium Core]], it's attacked by a mysterious person in a series of explosions. MC instinctively absorbs the [[Spatium Core]], then a woman tells MC that MC was born in [[Deepspace]], the [[Gaia key]] belongs to her alone, and without her [[The Fountain of Atei]] will only be a poor imitation. MC resolves to find the remains of the [[Gaia Research Center]], which take her into the [[N109 Zone]]. ([[05-01.01 New Objective]])

She finds the [[Zoion Hunt]] in full swing and [[Dimitri]] helps her ([[05-01.02 Charon]]) reach [[Sylus's base]] after a brief stop at [[Elysium]] where [[MC]] meets [[Aislinn]] again ([[05-01.03 Zoion Hunt]]). Once at the base, Sylus immediately notices and covers the power of the [[Spatium Core]], but he masters himself. She tells Sylus her plan, and he reveals that the [[Gaia Research Center]] is under [[Charon Arena]] ([[05-01.04 The Match]]) and that the arena will be destroyed after this year's games, so it's her last chance. Sylus initially declines her invitation to join the games, instead heading to attack [[Ever]] at a meeting they invited him to. There, [[Ever android]] attack with [[antimatter weapon]]s, and [[MC]] kills two birds with one stone by fleeing into the [[Zoion Hunt]] on purpose, dragging [[Sylus]] with her. ([[05-01.05 Join the Game]])

They fight their way through, betting on each other to take the top two spots on a leaderboard, before MC's instinct to protect an elderly woman allows that woman to stab her and run off. Sylus tends to her wounds, but the androids reappear and they kill 5 of the 14 then destroy a tracking chip planted on MC. ([[05-01.06 Hunting Moment]]) They relocate to [[Velocity Vintage Cars]] where they talk about ambition and fate, then safely sleep for a bit. ([[05-01.07 Soul Time]]) Upon waking, they execute MC's plan to split up--MC goes and deals with the rest of the [[Ever android]]s by disabling their leader unit while [[Sylus]] gets one of [[Charon's coin]]s, feeds on [[Wanderer]]s, and deals with the rest of the competition.

MC then heads to [[Elysium]] where the [[Connoisseur's Menu#Today's Special Sweet Evil Trap]] allows her to get the info for meeting Sylus. At the [[West District Docks]], he pulls up in a vintage car, then claims the coin was tampered with so he "fed it to a Wanderer." He's being followed, and a car chase ensues. Once free of their pursuers, Sylus crashes the car into the Arena's barrier to weaken it, allowing him to force inside with his Evol. They find a trap has been set with a massive [[Wanderer]], then prepare to face it head on.
