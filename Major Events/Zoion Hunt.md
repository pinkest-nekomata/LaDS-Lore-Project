**Overview**
* triennial (every three years)
	* The [[Main Story Timeline Flowchart.canvas|Main Story Timeline Flowchart]] puts this in late 2049/early 2050
* Boundaries are marked by orange-red lasers across the streets--anything inside is in the "killing zone".
* The area is patrolled by surveillance drones with multi-lens systems that register anyone in the zone into the contest automatically
* The first stage (free for all) never goes beyond six or seven days ([[05-01.05 Join the Game]])
* Sylus says this year's final has "some extra stakes" involved, so it'll be over in two days.

# Name
Zoion is ancient greek for "animal"/"beast" ([Wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ζῷον)) so this is essentially the "Beast Hunt".

There's a lot of greek myth theming around [[Sylus]] and the [[N109 Zone]], see also [[Sylus#Greek names]].

# Rules

From [[05-01.03 Zoion Hunt]]:
> [[Dimitri]]: People become hunters and prey to fight for a gold coin. With it, they'll be granted one wish from the Lord of Charon. At the very end, whoever enters the central arena with the coin and remains the last one standing becomes the winner. \[...] You can use Evol weapons, Protocore weapons, and your own fists... Wanderers are just another weapon people use to hunt each other.

People place bets on the fight, and the contestant with the most bets on them is shown at the top of the leaderboard. This makes them the primary target for the rest of the hunt.

Of this, [[Dimitri]] says:
> Opportunity is always born from danger.
> It's a traditional rule of the Zoion Hunt.
