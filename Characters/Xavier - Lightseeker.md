**Associated Outfit Description**
> The combat set of Xavier: Lightseeker. Bright and sharp, like a blade leveled at the enemy's chest.
> `Torn:` It has wear and tear through numerous trials. But that's alright, for it stands as a medal of a night who has traversed through the morning light.
> `Polar Odyssey:` This black knight outfit is worn by elite vanguards. While it may appear to be ocld and indifferent, it also helps keep a low profile and a professional attitude.
