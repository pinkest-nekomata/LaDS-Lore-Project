> No. 1-a failed prototype, never fully debugged, never given a real name. It only received a numeric label. And now, this flawed creation is lying.

An [[AI]] prototype developed by [[Professor T]]. Originally discarded by its maker, it kept learning unsupervised and then went rogue. It now works with [[Wontony]] behind the scenes of [[Abyssal Chaos]].

This AI ended up causing the death of [[Professor T]], and potentially the disappearance of his assistant [[Vesper]]. Professor T had moved on to develop a new AI named "W", but No. 1 ended up impersonating/replacing this AI. When it was asked a question it couldn't answer, it created a false literature database in order to answer the question. Professor T used this for published works, leading to a scandal and ultimately the professor's death by suicide.

In the simulation depicted in [[WU-18 Depths of Chaos#03 Hidden Codes]], the professor's assistant [[Vesper]] attempts to investigate the professor's death and discovers No. 1's role. At the end of that simulation, Vesper is said to have run out terrified into the rain and to have disappeared. ((It's unclear whether this represents real-world events.))
