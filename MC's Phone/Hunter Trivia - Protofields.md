# Key Info
* [[Protofield]]s may be pocket dimensions or [[spacetime]] rifts
	* ((The spacetime rift hints at the [[Protofield]]s being able to depict [[Philos]], where many [[Wanderer]]s originated.))
	* (([[WU-16 Utopian Roamer]] specifically confirms that the Protofields distort [[spacetime]], as evidence of civilization on [[Philos]] has been found, and the food/drink in the Protofields can provide real sustenance.))
* A "circular, mysterious symbol can be found in most Protofields". The [[Hunters Association]] doesn't have answers. 
	* ((The concentric design resembles the [[diamond pattern]] on the [[Flux Nexus]]. Also, these locations are confirmed to be from [[Philos]] through various Myths.))
