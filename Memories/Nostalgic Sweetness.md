# Memory
LI: [[Zayne]]
Rarity: n/a
Type: Bond

**Description**
> This Friday marks Zayne's long-awaited vacation. I made sure to ask for a day off that day. We originally planned to visit [[Maltosio]], a dessert shop in [[Bloomshore District]]. However, [[Zayne]] suddenly had a really bad toothache. Left with no other choice, I took him to the dentist...

# Key Info

* [[MC]] finds a place with [[Old Popcicle]]s three hours drive from [[Linkon]] for [[Zayne]] as a surprise to make up for his prior toothache. Sadly, the shop was closed for vacation.
	* Zayne finds them sweet snacks anyway
* [[Zayne]] reveals that he met [[MC]] during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] and tried to fix her frozen popsicle. It turned into "icy lumps" but she still appreciated it--and that's why he's still fond of [[Old Popcicle]]s, which are made by freezing soda.
	* Zayne says "I can't easily forget things and not worry. Unlike some." This could be him teasing, or it could hint at his guilt that this is when he lost control of his Evol and hurt her ([[Zayne losing control of his Evol]]) but it's not clear either way from this memory.


# Transcript(s)
MC asks why Zayne is so fond of [[Old Popcicle]]s.
> Zayne: When I was young, there was a... A girl I had met by chance. At the time, [[Wanderer]]s were everywhere, and people were on high alert. Hospitals had become shelters. The pediatric ward was filled with homeless children. It was an afternoon when I passed a small garden. A girl was crying, tears streaming down her face as she held a popsicle.
> MC: Was she sad that her popcicle melted?
> Zayne: It's hard to say. It could be because she was scared, she was injured, or simply missed her family. Many people cried every day back then. No one had the energy to care for others, let alone a stranger.
> MC: So... you just turned around and left?
> Zayne: ...I gave first aid to her melted popsicle.
> MC: Using your Evol?
> Zayne: The popsicle turned into a bunch of icy lumps. Still, she liked them and said she'd treat me to popsicles next time. She said as long as she had something sweet, she'd be happy even on a bad day.
> MC: Is that why you like dessert so much.
> Zayne: ...Perhaps. Though I didn't expect I would remember her words.
> MC: Nice memory.
> Zayne: I can't easily forget things and not worry. Unlike some.
> MC: (But this memory sounds...)
> \[...]
> `Dialogue option 1:`
> MC: The girl you mentioned... Was it me? I don't remember it well. but what you described feels familiar... I didn't expect to owe you a popsicle in the past *and* now...
> Zayne: `(Disbelieving, hopeful noise)` There is always a chance in the future. We have all the time in the world. 

> `Dialogue option 2:`
> MC: Cheer up, Zayne. Don't be pessimistic. Who knows? Maybe you two will meet again some day.
> Zayne: ...`(half-smiling)` I suppose we'll see.

> Zayne: Come, let's go find some soda. Since we can't buy popsicles, we'll just make them ourselves.
