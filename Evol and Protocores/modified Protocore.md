"Like a planet, the Protocore rotates slowly, enveloped by blue and red [[Protocurves]]." -- [[01-03.10 Invitation]], referring to the modified protocore from [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]

A theme linking [[Onychinus]] (especially under [[Sherman]]) and [[Ever]].

The first modified [[Protocore]] is recovered from the [[Flux Nexus]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] during [[01-03.06 Awakened Forest]].

> 3019.9 eV. The [[Protocurve]] of that [[Protocore]] and the energy value in its ground state is close to the energy value of the [[Aether Core]] in my heart. Meanwhile, the energy value for ordinary [[Protocore]]s is around 2500 eV. (This can't be a coincidence. That [[Protocore]] is a result of [[Onychinus]] using an [[Aether Core]] to modify it.)
