An [[Aether Core]] capable of influencing space, even creating entirely new spaces.
Though originally shattered, it has reassembled, drawn together by some gravitational pull. (See also [[Complete Aether Core Structure]].)

## Conjecture
Given that the [[Spatium Core]] can move objects through space, and [[Ever]] is theoretically going to be instrumental in Earth becoming [[Philos]], it's possible that they'll use the Spatium Core to "move" Earth through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] to the [[Philos]] system.
