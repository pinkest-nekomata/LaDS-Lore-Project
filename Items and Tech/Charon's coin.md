The "gold coin" that grants the holder one wish from the "Lord of Charon" ([[Dimitri]]) at the conclusion of the [[Zoion Hunt]]. It's always referred to as a "gold coin" in-game, and this page is titled "Charon's coin" for clarity. [[05-01.08 Connoisseur's Desserts]] specifies that the coin is also the "entry ticket" to get into the arena.

In [[05-01.08 Connoisseur's Desserts]], Sylus reports that while he found one of these coins (and still has its case) it was "tampered with" so he "fed it to a Wanderer". MC is understandably frustrated, but Sylus guarantees there are other ways into the arena.

The map displays markers where gold coins can be found (and fought over).
