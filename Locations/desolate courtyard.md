The location of [[02-01.02 Alike]], where [[Sylus]] and [[MC]] first met in the main story timeline.

There are the abandoned ruins of a church, including a bell tower with a bell that still functions.

The [[Man in Black]] arrived here, presumably after traveling south from [[Linkon]] City via [[Baire Boulevard]] and through the No-Hunt Zones No. 62-65, as MC does in [[05-01.02 Charon]]. In [[02-01.01 Cage]], he complains about feeling like he's driven that way before, indicating he didn't have the right tech to avoid the [[Protofield]] disturbances.
