Based on the persistently sunny weather, these events must begin somewhere from late spring to early fall in 2048.

Day -14: Approx date that [[Raymond]] starts showing symptons. ([[01-02.02 Close Encounter]])

Day 1: Events of [[01-01 To Begin]]
Day 2: Events of [[01-02 The First Mission]], up through [[01-02.05 Artsy Dreams]] and the first half of [[01-02.06 Next Target]]
Day 3: Meeting with [[Thomas]] at [[Flux Arts]], [[01-02.06 Next Target]] through [[01-02.13 In Hot Pursuit]]. It's not specifically stated whether [[01-03.01 Order No. 85]] is the same day or not, but given the evening-to-night transition and the urgency, and Jenna's reference to "last night's fluctuations" in [[01-03.10 Invitation]], it's likely the same night. This means Day 3 continues through [[01-03.08 Where Light Vanishes]].
Day 4: Events of [[01-03.09 Another Predicament]]
