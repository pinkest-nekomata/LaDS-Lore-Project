## Commentary
This anecdote is light on lore, but gives a lot of perspective on [[Zayne]]'s character.

# 01 The Legendary Dr. Zayne
[[John]] is a new intern at [[Akso Hospital]], intimidated by the rumors about the chief of surgery Dr. [[Zayne]]. Zayne is renowned as the best cardiac surgeon not only in [[Linkon]], but in the field. John nervously introduces himself to Zayne, and is instructed to observe the next cardiac surgery.

# 02 Expert Surgeon
During the very long surgery, [[John]] notes the stamina of [[Zayne]] and his first assistant, [[Greyson]]. Greyson breaks the ice, allowing [[John]] to share that he previously worked under a [[Dr. Lewis]]. They chat, but [[Zayne]] brings them back to the task at hand with something that may be a veiled reprimand or dry humor.

# 03 Scarier than a Demon
[[John]] and [[Greyson]] head over to check on a patient, [[Zack]], and find him acting out and giving the nurse trouble. [[Zayne]] arrives and quickly defuses the situation with a mix of empathy and sternness. [[Zack]] admits he was only acting out due to boredom, since noone will stay with him. [[Zayne]] offers to keep him company, and that settles the issue. [[John]] is amazed [[Zayne]] can "terrify such an intimidating patient.

# 04 Under the Sunlight
[[John]] happens across [[Zayne]] in the courtyard on one of his 1-2 days off each month, playing chess with [[Zack]]. He continues to manage the cantankerous old man with his firm yet emphatic demeanor, and [[John]] sees him act with warmth for the first time. He recalls [[Greyson]] saying how hard it can be for elderly patients whose families won't visit them as they recover after their surgeries, and he's touched by Zayne's empathy.

# 05 Once Ice Melts
[[John]] goes to deliver a report to [[Zayne]], who tells him the next steps for a patient [[Jeanne]]. If her family can't come to her procedure tomorrow, [[John]] is to accompany her. [[John]] expresses concern that [[Jeanne]] doesn't trust him, so it might be awkward. [[Zayne]] considers this, recalling how he used to do a lot to earn the trust of his patients--[[John]] understands and takes it to heart.

# 06 The Best Doctor
As promised, [[John]] is helping [[Jeanne]] to her procedure. But then an urgent call comes for him to fill in as [[Zayne]]'s second assistant for a surgery. The surgery goes well, the patient's new artificial heart working as intended.

Afterward, [[John]] can't help but ask why he was the one chosen today. [[Zayne]] responds that he knows that John needs to write a paper on the subject, and [[John]] is surprised and touched by the consideration.

Now that John's time at the [[Division of Cardiac Surgery]] is nearing a close, he's reluctant to leave and now feels affectionately towards Dr. Zayne. As he meets a nervous incoming intern, he assures them that Zayne isn't scary at all--rather, "He's the best doctor I've ever had the pleasure to meet."
