A plush dog owned by [[Mia]] and another "survivor" of the [[Cascade District explosion]]. [[Mia]] gives [[MC]] this plushie as "a present" after they meet at the hospital in [[04-01.05 Visitation]].

It's also meant to help MC find [[Kevi]]--when the tail is pulled, a recording plays. Mia says "Where are you hiding? I'm done playing!" Kevi's voice replies, "Mia, you're so silly. I'm in our secret base." Mia says, "But we said not to hide in the secret base. You're cheating!"
