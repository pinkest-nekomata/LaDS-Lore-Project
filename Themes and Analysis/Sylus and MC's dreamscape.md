Though it's yet to be clearly explained, Sylus and MC can share each other's dreams under certain circumstances. It's clearly implied that some dreams  are shared dreams that they both remember later, though MC's not entirely sure what to make of it. This interpretation is also supported by dream sharing being a common theme in soul bond stories, and they retain their soul bond in the current timeline.

Even when dreams aren't shared, they're often meaningful so those references are also included here.

# Appearances

* [[No Defense Zone]], prime example
* [[Within Reach]] begins with what may or may not be a shared dream, though it continues the theme of dreams being significant
