# Summary
With the [[Protocore Cluster]]s destroyed, [[MC]] realizes she's at [[Akso Hospital]] and therefore still in the dream. She goes into the mist-filled halls, a callback to Zayne's other recurring nightmare, then emerges from the mist into his apartment.

She finds him on the ground, ice spreading down his wrist and up his neck like when he loses control of his Evol. But this ice is blackened, so she suspects more is going on. She resonates to help melt the ice, and Zayne tries to stop her. ((In [[Snowy Serenity]], she does a similar thing and the resonance causes her severe pain.)) MC insists on taking care of him.

But as she's clearing the ice from his hand, she's suddenly back in the misty hallway, her heart beating loudly. She collapses, and Zayne carries her to a hospital bed where black marks can be seen on her hand. He uses his Evol, ice spreading across her and then withdrawing, and the black marks appear on his skin instead.

MC wakes up and realizes that Zayne has been risking himself while she's unconscious.

## Commentary
The return to the misty hall of [[Akso Hospital]] confirms that this second layer of the nightmare is the one where he sees her in the halls of the hospital.

Here, we see Zayne slowly agree to let MC help him with this nightmare.

# Details

After destroying her [[Protocore Cluster]], [[MC]] finds herself in a garden at the back of the hospital, but can tell that something is off. What she sees is the garden of [[Akso Hospital]], but their true location is [[Chansia Hospital]].

She heads into the hospital, where a white mist rises around her. Once it's cleared, she's back at Zayne's place, and finds him lying on the floor. As she helps him up, he confirms that they're now in the dream's second layer, and the [[Wanderer]] is still around.

Zayne clutches his left arm and [[MC]] notices ice, indicating [[Zayne losing control of his Evol]].

> Zayne: The ice... it's dangerous. Don't touch--

Then MC hears in her head:
> ?? ([[Zayne - Foreseer]]): ... It's too dangerous. I won't be able to control... Leave. Now.
* This is from [[Tower of Secrets]] (Chapter citation #todo, [YT Link](https://youtu.be/tExj8mpN_YQ?si=1MWQq4zSvZ73TUEy&t=2396))

The ice MC sees on Zayne's skin is blackened this time, spreading along his wrists and neck.
> MC: I don't think you're just losing control of your Evol... Let me see if I can help.

The kindled scene for the storyline begins here. ([[Frozen Nightfall]])

Zayne insists he's fine. [[MC]] resonates with him, which has previously allowed her to control the backlash when he loses control of his Evol ([[Snowy Serenity]]). The black ice starts to melt, and MC says it will just take time to resolve.

Zayne tells her to not waste her time, trying to say they can still go after the [[Wanderer]]--but MC insists. She pushes him down, telling him he needs to listen.

After a moment of surprise and conflict, Zayne relents, responding to her question of where to focus the resonance. She tells him that as the expert on Wanderers, she knows it's not safe to rush in without being prepared. 

She makes a comment that she won't save him if he runs in alone, and he says, "I'd hope so." She's stunned, but Zayne says, "I know how this nightmare ends" and "The [[Wanderer]] isn't the only threat here", telling her she might have to leave him behind.

MC won't have that, and tells him that he agreed to listen to her--he's not allowed to talk like that anymore. She grabs his hand and resonates, clearing the ice there too.

> MC: Wait, this is...

The view and scene change. MC is no longer holding Zayne's hand, but is looking down at a tile floor and clutching her chest as her heart beats loudly. White mist fills the area. ((This appears to be back in the Linkon Hospital hallway, the layer of dream where MC was before being in the room with Zayne.))
> MC: Zayne... Be careful...

She looks up as Zayne approaches, then collapses as he asks what happened. He leans over her and says something, but no voice line plays. He picks her up and carries her through the hall as her eyes shut. 

Zayne sets her on a hospital bed, putting his hand over hers. Black smudges mark her hand.
> Zayne: Letting you step into this nightmare, perhaps, was another mistake... But at least I have one last choice.

He focuses on his Evol, and frost moves up her arm to her chest. Four little snowflakes rise from her, then join into a sphere with a snowflake in the center. Zayne grabs the snowflake, reabsorbing the power--and the black marks appear on his hands instead, along with more ice.

> *As I gather my thoughts, the wary face before me momentarily merges with a blurry image of Zayne in my fragmented memories. But they immediately separate.*
> MC: Wait... When I was pulled into the [[Protofield]], I was attacked by that [[Wanderer]] and lost consciousness... The wound should be on my body... but it's gone.
> *I give Zayne an inquisitive look. I want an answer, but he averts his gaze instead.*
> MC: Zayne, what did you do while I was unconscious?

((In [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon - 10]], [[MC]] reveals that [[Zayne]] has been using his power to help heal her while she's unconscious.))
