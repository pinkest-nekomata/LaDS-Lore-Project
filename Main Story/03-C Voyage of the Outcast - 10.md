# Summary

[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] reach the [[Traceback II]]--here, it's intact. Yet more secrets from [[Xavier]]'s past are revealed. MC learns of the [[Backtrackers]], and that [[Soren]] was a member.

[[Xavier]] believes the ship can get them out of the [[Protofield]]. When he goes to launch it, it recognizes him as Captain. It then gives an warning that the [[Protocore]] Energy is low.

Fortunately, it's equipped to use [[Evol]] as emergency power. This time, [[Xavier]] asks her to resonate with him and use the [[Aether Core]]'s power. As the ship takes off, it forces the [[Wanderer]] to reveal itself.

# Details
Their destination is revealed as a massive spaceship hidden behind the trees.
> Unlike the wreckage I saw in [[No-Hunt Zone 42]], this one is more intact with far more sophisticated engineering.
* ((We know from [[Silvery Polyphony]] and [[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]] that the [[Traceback II]] wreckage is near [[No-Hunt Zone 19]]. Given that this wreckage has "more sophisticated engineering", its not immediately clear what wreckage MC is referring to here.))

Inside is a command center and scattered papers. MC asks if he really intents to use the spaceship to escape.
> Xavier: It can break through the most chaotic gravitational energy flux. A [[Protofield]] might not stand a chance against it. Let's just try and see. \[...]
> Traceback II: [[Traceback II]], [[Philos]] [[1101]]-PLS is now online...
> MC: [[Philos]]... that name sounds familiar.
> Xavier: ...It's my homeland. A place far away from here.
> *I silently repeat the name to myself and feel a strange sensation as it resounds in the depths of my heart.
> I pick up the papers next to him. The messy handwriting and symbols seem like they're from another universe.*
> MC: "[[Backtrackers]] logbook", "Spatiotemporal Coordinate Parameters"... You and [[Soren]] were both members of the [[Backtrackers]]...?
> Xavier: Yes. \[...] Even though we called it a "small group", there were quite a lot of us at one point. But after all this time, only a few of us remain.

The ship asks for an identity check, then refers to [[Xavier]] as Captain. He then nudges MC about whether she has more questions. She lets him off the hook for now, trusting that his motives are good. But she promises she'll ask more when they're out of danger. She bumps a random switch, accidentally starting a sound clip of [[Xavier]] reading a poem on the ship's longs. ((This is from #todo, secret times. Somewhat tragically, when he recorded that log, he knew [[Queen MC]] would never hear it. It's ironic and a bit cute that [[MC]] gets to hear a bit of it now.))

He covers her ears, and pretends it's not him. Seeing his ears turning red, she suggests the ship just missed him and is imitating him. Before she can tease him, an alarm goes off and reports that [[Protocore]] Energy is too low. A sharp pang goes through MC's chest as the [[Protofield]] acts up again. Xavier overrides the warning.

He assures her it'll be fine, that Protocore Energy isn't the only kind that will work. He straps a device to his wrist, sits next to her, then pulls her hand to his chest.
> Xavier: I need you.
> MC: You're... going to use your Evol as fuel?! No!
> *I try to pull my hand away, but he tightly holds onto it.*
> MC: Don't even think about it. The [[Protofield]] already drained your energy. You're not allowed to use your [[Evol]] right now!
> MC: (It's very obvious that fueling this spaceship will be too much for him.)
> Xavier: It's not a big deal. Using Evol as emergency fuel is actually one of this ship's unique features. In the past, Evol came to our rescue during several crises. It enabled us to make safe emergency landings. Besides, I've got you here with me. You're aware of the changes an [[Aether Core]] can bring. With your current strength, you can resonate and enhance my Evol, right?
> MC: But--
> Xavier: Only you have the power to help us safely leave the Protofield.
> MC: ...
> Xavier: Trust me.
> *He cups my cheek with his other hand. With a soft voice, he makes a promise to me.*
> Xavier: Your power will keep me safe.

The ship's launch countdown begins. The pain in MC's chest grows sharper. Still, she agrees, and they resonate.

> Violent tremors and a sense of weightlessness engulf us. After countless voyages through the boundaries of space, the spaceship plunges into the unknown once more.

Outside the ship, it's chaotic. Xavier's light remains a steady presence. But then MC senses something is suppressing his Evol, preventing a complete [[resonance]]. Xavier tells her to keep going, and her power becomes a blade to cut through the barrier. They slice through space, and the [[Wanderer]] finally reveals itself.
* ((This suppression is likely [[Xavier]]'s [[suppression collar]]. This gives us a hint that [[MC]]'s [[Evol]] may be able to temporarily override its limits.))
