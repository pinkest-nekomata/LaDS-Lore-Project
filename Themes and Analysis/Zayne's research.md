> "The theoretical model is quite good. A lot of students have tried to explore the uses of [[Protocore]]s before, but their ideas were limited by the methods."

> "...Zayne never slacked off for even a second and had double-checked, triple-checked the data. **He understood the importance of this project to Zayne** and trusted that he had it under control."

> *Zayne closed his eyes and shook his head. He took out the only remaining image from his data and handed it to Dr. Noah. The picture was a heart that was mostly covered in [[black crystals]]. To be more precise, it looked like a human heart, beating and growing out of black crystals.*

* ((This chapter being named "Oath", along with setting these events near the first-years swearing their medical oaths, connects Zayne's decision here to the idea of the Hippocratic oath--first, do no harm. He believes this research is harming/could harm people, so he destroys the data.))

> "If you had kept going, maybe you would've already broken free from the shackles of natural law," Carter says. "Zayne, your talents are wasted at [[Akso Hospital]]. [[Xander Sciences]] doesn't want to see a genius like you be forgotten. The [[Evol]] technology you're insisting on is so last year. No one wants an artificial lump that needs to be charged in their heart now. Protoore tech is the golden brick that will pave the way to the future."
