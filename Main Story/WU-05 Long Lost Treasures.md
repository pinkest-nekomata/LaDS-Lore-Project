# Overview

Main POV character: 
Cover image: A submerged and mournful [[Lemurian]] statue

Both [[Ever]] and [[Rafayel]] are keen to prevent intel on [[Lemuria]] from leaking to the public.

## Summary
((Per 06 below, this anecdote happens around/before the start of the main story, when [[Rafayel]] has "recently returned" to the country.))

One of [[Ever]]'s hitmen, a "raincoat", prepares to dispose of [[Tony]], a movie director who was researching [[Lemuria]] for his upcoming project. [[Raincoat]] decides to listen to the audio files he's supposed to destroy, which tell the story of a group of researchers from [[Deepspace Academy]] discovering a [[Protocore]] weapon in [[Lemuria]]'s ruins, then getting spooked and trying to hide the evidence.

The weapon "implicates [[Ever]] Group", so the researchers try to flee before Ever can get to them. Some suspect they're being stalked by [[Lemuria]]'s god, which is a clue that [[Rafayel]] has been following them. It's left ambiguous whether the researchers successfully hid, were taken out by [[Ever]], or were taken out by [[Rafayel]].

As [[Raincoat]] gets through the last audio recording, [[Rafayel]] suddenly appears and destroys the phone. He strikes a deal with [[Raincoat]]--he wants any info that [[Ever]] has on [[MC]]. If he can get that, he'll give [[Raincoat]] a way out of [[Ever]]'s grasp, since he already knows too much. Thus, what will be Rafayel's first meeting with the [[mysterious Ever representative]] is scheduled.

## Commentary
This story seems to be set around/before the start of the main story, because this is also a time when [[Rafayel]] is described as having "returned to the country" at the start of the year ([[01-02.06 Next Target]]), and in this he's "recently returned". So, this would be approx 6mo before [[Rafayel]]'s meeting with the [[mysterious Ever representative]] in [[01-08.10 Trap]], and presumably the start of his working relationship with said person.

From this story, we can conclude that [[Rafayel]] already knows that [[Ever]] has reason to be keeping an eye on [[MC]], if not wanting her outright dead. His working relationship likely serves two purposes--trying to help keep [[MC]] alive, as well as protecting [[Lemuria]]. We know he was stalking the other researchers too, and maybe even was responsible for their "disappearance".

# 01 Submerged Rock
A popular billionaire director, [[Tony]], is unconscious and bound in the trunk of a car near an abandoned dock. His captor is a [[Raincoat]], and does "white glove" work for [[Ever]]. His (now broken) commitment to never go after public figures kept him hidden for many years.

While doing research for his upcoming movie, [[Tony]] has stumbled across information that [[Ever]] wants to keep quiet. Specifically, voice memos on Tony's phone. "Raincoat" is supposed to wipe the files and dispose of the body, but he decides to take a listen first.

# 02 Audio File No.1: Mo Art Studio
[[Tony]] is interviewing [[Rafayel]]. He wants to set his fantasy-themed movie in [[Lemuria]], and the [[Deepspace Academy]] has said that [[Rafayel]] is an expert. Rafayel brushes this off, saying he knows nothing about [[Lemuria]]. Tony notices that the oceans in Rafayel's paintings "feel alive", but Rafayel says they're just normal paintings and redirects Tony to the [[Deepspace Academy]]'s archeological team which is looking for [[Lemurian]] ruins.

# 03 Audio File No.2: Disappearance
[[Tony]] is talking to a handyman who worked on the ship during the exploration, but never dived. The ship arrived on the 20th. The leader Ms. Eleanor, Fred, Yennifer, and Professor Sean went down in the submersible. They set up an underwater base and expected to return by the 4th, but was delayed to the 11th.

The day after the expedition, an argument occurred, then Eleanor and Fred, senior members on the team, left the [[Deepspace Academy]]. This caused a stir, and then shortly after, Yennifer disappeared too. The handiman realized that a video clip had been deleted from her camera, so he tried to tell her, but couldn't get into contact with her or anyone else from the team--except Professor Sean, who sounded off and hung up as soon as the handyman mentioned archeology.

In a memo recorded shortly after, [[Tony]] reveals that he cashed in some favors to find out that Eleanor, Fred, and Yennifer fully vanished--haven't been home, haven't answered calls, etc. The mystery proves inspiring for his script.

> Tsk, missing archeologists, deleted underwater footage, secrets of the ocean floor... That's quite a synopsis.

# 04 Audio File No.3: Blue Fish
[[Tony]] manages to meet with Professor Sean in person, though he says he's no longer a professor with [[Deepspace Academy]]. As soon as Tony mentions [[Lemuria]], Sean gets spooked. But Tony assures him he doesn't want facts, just ideas.

> "Reality...? Oh... my sense of reality has changed because of my time in [[Lemuria]]..."

Sean confesses that he saw things he left out of his reports because they were too strange. But with the cover of "fiction", he divulges the details to Tony. During the dive, the submersible got caught in a whirlpool. A school of blue fish came to their rescue and guided the submersible to [[Lemuria]]'s ruins. Sean believes the blue fish to be sentient, with their own thoughts and feelings.

Sean confesses they "saw someone" who was "dressed just like us", but when Tony pushes for more detail, Sean tells him he needs to leave. Tony's last question, which goes unanswered, is how the ship could still be getting signals from the submersible if Sean was reporting that they'd lost all contact due to the whirlpool. Who was the ship getting signals from?

In another follow-up memo, [[Tony]] reviews the suspicious details and reports that the deleted video is almost restored.

# 05 Audio File No.4: Shadow Underneath
Tony's IT "friend" was able to restore only one frame of video, as well as the call history of Fred's phone.

The frame shows a skeleton holding what looks like a [[Protocore]] weapon. 

> Protocore weapons were only invented in the last decade or so... How could this one have appeared in the ruins of [[Lemuria]]? Is it possible the underwater city didn't sink naturally?

# 06 Audio File No.5: Conflict
A call from Fred to Eleanor.

Fred declares he's definitely leaving. He recognized the [[Protocore]] weapons, which implicates the [[Ever]] Group. Fred reveals that someone's been stalking them ever since they left [[Lemuria]]'s ruins, and Sean and Yennifer thought it was Lemuria's god.
* ((This is likely a reference to [[Rafayel]] keeping an eye on them, since he's the reincarnated [[Sea God]], and his likeness may have appeared in the ruins.))

Fred refers to having deleted the video, and tells Eleanor she's endangering their lives if she keeps looking into [[Lemuria]]. Apparently Eleanor is considering taking the fall for the team, but Fred doesn't think such a fabrication will work on [[Ever]], and [[Ever]] will come after all of them.

In a voice memo, Tony wonders if [[Ever]] went after Fred--and then the memo ends with Tony's own kidnapping at [[Raincoat]]'s hand.

Thus we come full circle back to [[Raincoat]] and [[Tony]] at the dock.
> He had dug up the [[Protocore]] weapon buried deep within the ruins. No wonder he got on Ever's execution list.

Just as [[Raincoat]] is about to throw the phone back in the trunk, [[Rafayel]] arrives. He uses his flame [[Evol]] to destroy the phone, and casually approaches, saying "Niiice. I got the person and the evidence in one go."

Based on [[Raincoat]]'s awareness of the surrounding area, he guesses (with some disbelief) that Rafayel must have appeared from the ocean.

Rafayel strikes up a conversation, noting how it's true that knowing too much is dangerous--and implying that [[Raincoat]]'s own position with [[Ever]] is perilous. 

> This mysterious artist who recently returned to the country has countless connections with Lemuria.

Rafayel pitches [[Raincoat]] on the prospect of working for him instead, giving him a way out of [[Ever]]'s clutches. What [[Rafayel]] wants is to know if [[MC]] is on [[Ever]]'s hit list--and if she is, he wants all the info they have on her. They both know that [[Raincoat]] doesn't have the whole list, though. Only "that person" (i.e. the [[mysterious Ever representative]]) does.

[[Raincoat]] decides to bite, telling [[Rafayel]] that someone will be waiting for him at [[The Nest]] the following night to negotiate.

Of [[The Nest]], Rafayel says:
> The lights there are blinding. Doesn't the person behind you feel the same?
* ((I have a hunch this is meant to have a double meaning, but I'm unsure. Maybe something lost in translation?))

[[Raincoat]] asks if the girl ([[MC]]) is his enemy, to which [[Rafayel]] flippantly replies that she's his lover.

[[Raincoat]] then also mentions that [[Rafayel]] is 6th on [[Ever]]'s hit list--and [[Rafayel]] is offended that he's not at the top of the list.

> [...] a curious inkling begins to form in [[Raincoat]]'s mind. He thinks of the mysterious deaths--the rumored [[Sea Monster Murders]] that once shook other cities.
> Then, he thinks of the many outsiders the [[Ever]] Group called "research samples" that he and other "Raincoats" had dealt with.
> After thinking for a few seconds, [[Raincoat]] calmly asks, "Mr. Rafayel, I presume you have your own list. What's my ranking?"

He doesn't rank on Rafayel's list yet. Rafayel tells him to leave the director alive, as it's better if there's less blood on his hands. Raincoat is fine with this, and offers to shake on the successful partnership. Rafayel declines, then leaves, insulting [[Raincoat]]'s new coat along the way.
