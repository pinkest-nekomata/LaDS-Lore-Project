[[Zayne]]'s branch in [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] to locate a [[Spatium Core]] fragment.

# Summary
A [[Wanderer]] with a [[Beta-Protocurve]] has been attacking people at [[Chansia Hospital]], causing people with [[Protocore Syndrome]] to go into coma or shock. [[Zayne]] and [[Greyson]] are sent over as assisting doctors, and [[MC]] joins as their hunter escort.

Once at the hospital, one patient is revealed to be different. He has unusual [[Metaflux]] readings and scale-like growths in his heart that resemble the [[Wanderer crystal sample]] [[MC]] got from the [[N109 Zone]]. During the surgery, a [[Wanderer]] almost appears. The patient recovers abnormally quickly, claiming to have been trapped in a nightmare. Suddenly, the [[Wanderer]] shows itself and pulls [[Zayne]] and [[MC]] into a [[Protofield]] based on Zayne's nightmares.

Zayne appears as [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]], and together they fight their way through the "dream". Once they escape and kill the [[Wanderer]], they gain an [[Aether Core]] fragment, later revealed to be part of the [[Spatium Core]]. They also find a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that had summoned the monsters to [[Chansia Hospital]] and was made by [[Ever]].
