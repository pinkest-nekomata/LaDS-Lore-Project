The name of [[Carter]]'s [[Xander Sciences]]-funded spin off of [[Zayne's research]] ([[WU-02 Snowy Stairs#03 Undying Tree]]).

They're trying to use [[Protocore]] energy to revive dead cells and regenerate tissue. However, things are going poorly without [[Zayne]]'s insights. [[Zayne]] was so horrified by what he'd found that he destroyed the data and ceased working on his research.

Compare to [[The Fountain of Atei]], a mysterious project planning to implant [[Protocore]]s into human hearts.

Also note in [[Immortality No Longer a Dream!]] that clinical trials on humans with [[Protocore]] energy are technically illegal, but that hasn't stopped this project, especially as [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon]] features another [[X-Heart]] patient.
