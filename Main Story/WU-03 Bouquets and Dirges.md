Rafayel attends his friend [[Talia]]'s wedding and [[Raymond]]'s funeral

## Summary
((This story takes place shortly after [[01-07.03 Secret Tracking]], as [[Raymond]] has recently died.))

[[Rafayel]] attends the wedding of his [[Lemurian]] friend [[Talia]], who's marrying a human. He feels out-of-place in the joyful celebration, but [[Talia]] urges him to see that she and the rest of the [[Lemurian]] survivors are finding "anchors"--i.e., reasons to keep living and moving forward even without [[Lemuria]]. [[Rafayel]], however, remains devoted to restoring [[Lemuria]].

He then goes to the funeral of [[Raymond]], but the flowers he brings aren't for the collector, but [[Raymond's Lemurian skeleton]]. She was the daughter of one of [[Rafayel]]'s late relatives. [[Talia]] and the other [[Lemurian]]s are grateful he's dead.

[[Rafayel]] then goes to pick up [[flame lillies]], waffling on whether or not to give them to "someone" ([[MC]]). Can they be his "anchor"? The story ends on a melancholy note.

# 01 Emerald Vines
[[Rafayel]] discusses [[Talia]]'s upcoming wedding with a jewelry designer, [[Charles]]. He met [[Rafayel]] doing conservation work, as he enjoys gardening in his spare time. His garden will be the venue for [[Talia]]'s wedding.

As they discuss choosing flowers for lovers, [[Charles]] hints at "a girl he caught a glimpse of in [[Rafayel]]'s photo album," who is almost certainly [[MC]].

[[Charles]] continues his walk and returns to hear [[Rafayel]] telling [[Talia]] over the phone that he won't be attending her wedding.

> If Charles wasn't doing a commisison for [[Talia]]'s wedding, he would've believed Rafayel.
> "But I've finally found someone I like."
> "You said the same thing last time."
> "And how long ago was that? Why are you so stingy with your blessings?"
> "I blessed you when you made [[the pact]]. Any more would be pointless."
> "What do you mean? Not everyone is as lucky as you..."
> "I'm hanging up."

Rafayel and Charles then discuss the jewelry commissions for Talia's wedding, and Talia laughs over the phone, signaling that Rafayel hadn't actually hung up. Even though the surprise is spoiled, Talia is delighted, and she actually hangs up this time.

Rafayel is still moody, and Charles guesses he's thinking about his own lover.

# 02 Wedding
It's a relaxed and lovely wedding, and [[Talia]] is happily dancing.

[[Rafayel]] overhears some other [[Lemurian]]s talking about the couple, commenting how the groom is too plain.

> Rafayel turns to see a familiar face he hadn't seen since "the disaster." He cheerfully plays an ancient [[Lemurian]] instrument, a happy melody flowing from his moving fingertips.

[[Talia]] finds [[Rafayel]] and compliments the garden, asking [[Rafayel]] to thank [[Charles]]. Rafayel asks whether the groom approved of the venue, and Talia says that he's happy when she's happy. The groom also designed her wedding dress. After a pause, Rafayel then shares some news:

> "[[Raymond]] is dead."
> Talia takes a deep breath, a smile blooming on her face. "Then we can all get a good night's sleep for now."
> "Yeah, for now."

Talia nudges [[Rafayel]] as not accepting even fleeting happiness.

> Almost all the familiar and unfamiliar [[Lemurian]] survivors are present. The music is harmonious, and the singing is rich, but every smile seems to be covered with a grey veil.

Talia tells Rafayel that she's getting married not to forget the past, but to live in the present. She and the other [[Lemurian]] are looking for an anchor--a reason to live. She implies that Rafayel doesn't realize how important it is to have an anchor like that, but he responds that "Lemuria is more important." (i.e. restoring [[Lemuria]] after the disaster.)

> "Lemuria will always be important." Talia puts down her glass, looking serious. "But what about you? When your own heart is devouring you, is there anything that can pull you back? Can you really let her go?"
> The light in Rafayel's eyes dims at her last question.
> "Rafayel, have you ever thought about your own wedding?"
> [...]
> "No."

He's quiet for a while, then turns to leave this happiness that isn't for him.

# 03 Gardenia
[[Rafayel]] collects gardenia's from [[Charles]]'s garden for "a relative's daughter". Charles informs him that gardenias represent freedom, happiness, and rebirth. They're typically for the start of the school year or birthday parties.

Rafayel affirms his choice, then informs [[Charles]] that the flowers are actually for a funeral, since "her father can no longer give her flowers."

# 04 Lament
[[Rafayel]] arrives at [[Raymond]]'s funeral. [[Herman]], the butler, recognizes him and seems surprised. Rafayel walks straight through the funeral, up to the glass where [[Raymond's Lemurian skeleton]] is. The mourner ahead of him is angling for an inheritance.

When it's Rafayel's turn, he leans over the coffin and places the gardenias on it so the most beautiful side faces the fish tank. He silently recites a eulogy for her.

> A familiar song begins.
> [[Talia]] stands at the very front of the hall, singing a dirge. Rafayel opens his eyes. The dazzling sunlight passes through the fish tank, and the skeleton inside silently gazes at the sky in a forever-frozen pose.
> He knows who Talia is singing for, just as she knows who Rafayel came here for.

As Rafayel leave, an [[Raymond]]'s mother accuses him of murdering her son via [[Raymond's painting]].

> How sad... With her son dead, the anchor that held her up was taken by a dark tide.

Rafayel leaves.

# 05 Bouquet
A week later, [[Rafayel]] visits [[Talia]] in Verono [sic] ((should be [[Verona]]?)) They discuss the dresses Talia's husband has designed for her, and Rafayel asks if he's ever designed a wedding dress. He hasn't, but Talia promises a friends and family discount.

As Rafayel leaves, Talia tosses him a small bouquet. She'd wanted to toss it to him at the wedding (a superstition/tradition which means he'd be the next to get married) but he left early.

> An unknown flower sits in his palm, reminding him of someone.

As he leaves, he sees many familiar faces among the [[Verona]] street performers--implying that many are [[Lemurian]]s who've found lives and reasons to live there.

# 06 Gloriosa
[[Rafayel]] goes to get fiery [[flame lillies]] from [[Charles]]. Charles guesses they might be for a special someone.

Rafayel leaves and waffles on whether he's going to keep them for himself or give them to "someone" ([[MC]]). He wonders if the [[flame lillies]] can be his anchor.

> Under the night sky, the black waves haven't fully rolled in. For now, he still has a chance to get a good sleep.
> Until he must face the never-ending tsunami in his dreams alone.
