# Summary

[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] attempt to fight the [[Wanderer]] and realize it can hide in glass and mirrors. [[Xavier]] uses his power to shatter all the glass at once, forcing the [[Wanderer]] to materialize and manifest its [[Protofield]].

# Details

[[Xavier]] attacks with his light blade, and [[MC]] draws her gun. She realizes that the [[Wanderer]] is hiding in the glass. It appears as a streak of purple light. It then flies towards MC, causing her vision to go blurry and she collapses. Xavier is at her side a moment later, and with a shattering of glass, the effect on MC is broken. She's physically intact, so wonders if it was her imagination.

The train then pulls into [[West Garden Station]] again, and MC and Xavier realize it's stuck in a loop. The shards of glass on the floor are actually shards of mirror.

> Xavier: That Wanderer can travel between glass and mirrors. Find it, otherwise the train will keep going in circles forever.

MC asks where to start, since there are so many windows.

Xavier raises two fingers to his neck, causing his [[suppression collar]] to appear. It's blue this time. He summons his light blade, sending out a blast of energy that shatters all the glass in the train car at once. A shard of glass with the purple light in it appears and then shatters, forcing the [[Wanderer]] out.
