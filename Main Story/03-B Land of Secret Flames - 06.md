# Summary
[[MC]] is frustrated that the [[Ever]] reps ruined her plan. [[Rafayel]] tries to steer her clear of [[Maxwell]] being suspicious, suggesting that the [[Ever]] reps are a bigger threat. [[MC]] shifts her focus there, but [[Rafayel]] distracts her with food, then tells her to go to bed.

Once she falls asleep, she has a dark dream about a mournful song on the ocean. ((This is implied to be a [[Lemurian]] elegy, like the one mentioned in [[Siren's Song]].))

# Details
[[MC]] complains that the "island buyers" ruined her plan. They try to guess what [[Ever]] could want there, but don't have any ideas. [[Rafayel]] dramatically complains that his wrist has been injured.

[[MC]] reveals that [[Maxwell]] is her suspect, but [[Rafayel]] says he's probably not that suspicious--just wealthy and "hopelessly in love". MC calls his bluff, saying that [[Rafayel]] wouldn't have any interest in [[Maxwell]] if that were the case.

Rafayel reveals some grape mousse (which he'd suggested during their "argument") and they go out to eat it on the terrace. MC is distracted thinking on how to get close to the jewelry, but Rafayel assures her that they'll figure it out. He suggests they should be more worried about the [[Ever]] reps. Due to his connections, MC takes this to heart--then starts worrying about how to deal with them. [[Rafayel]] tries to distract her with candy and tells her to go to bed and get some rest.

> Maybe the sweetness made me drowsy. Hearing the churning sea, I vaguely remember resting my head on a pillow and closing my eyes. Before I realize it, I'm slowly falling asleep.
> The sound of the waves reverberates near my ears and slowly flows into my dark dream.
> Faint moonlight spills over the pitch-black sea, carrying an ethereal chant from afar.
* (([[Song of Lost]] plays, the same as with [[Raymond's painting]].))

> MC: This is...
> *...I feel like I've been here before. As if sensing my arrival, the singing grows more peculiar and sad as if it wants to convey something to me. An inexplicable sorrow stirs in my heart and mingles with nostalgia. I can't help but reach out to that elusive melody.
> Yet the waves surge, and the sea roars and swells under the howling winds. It's at that moment the song dissipates. It drowns in the raging torrents.*
