**Description**
> With Linkon New Year around the corner, I can't help but wonder: how did Sylus celebrate in the past?

# Key Info
* It's eventually revealed that Sylus comes here every year.
	* The red string bracelet vendor recognizes Sylus from last year.
	* So does the vendor selling tiger puppets, who says Sylus overpaid last year--and that he's been there many years over.
* Sylus and MC get red string bracelets with gold and red thread intertwined--the vendor tells them this represents "a match predestined"/"a perfect match".
* Their Evol linkage ([[Sylus and MC's Evol linkage]]) can appear at-will now.
* MC expresses some concern that her "cunning prey" (Sylus) might slip away. He assures her that he can't be made to do anything he doesn't want to do--he's there because he wants to be.
* They're still being a bit cagey about wanting to spend all day together.
* They get a sketch from a caricature artist, and Sylus ends up keeping it instead of MC.

# Trivia
* Sylus's intimidating aura works on the performers and passers-by at the Linkon temple festival for Linkon New Years.
* Due to his dangerous job, MC has given Sylus good luck charms from many deities, just in case some of them don't bless him.
* Sylus loves fireworks.
* Sylus bought a bunch of tiger puppets.
* Tonight, he smells like wine and fireworks.

# Quotes

> Sylus: When I'm in danger, you show up more often than those deities.
> MC: True. I guess I'm very persistent and always around.
> Sylus: Thinking about you but not seeing you is more annoying.

> MC: You're not going to give me any sweet words today?
> Sylus: If you want to hear them so badly...
> *I stand on my tiptoes and lean in.*
> Sylus: Then there's even more of a reason to not say them. The harder it is to get something, the more you want to have it.

> Sylus: I told you I'm not exactly good at fitting in.
> MC: Then did we end up together because we put in the effort?

> Sylus: Everyone here showed up in pairs. Is there anything to boast about when I see happiness that doesn't belong to me?
> MC: Then why do you visit this place every year?
> Sylus: I... decided last year that I wouldn't show up this year.
> MC: But you're here now.

> \[...] in this warm, peaceful world, there's a place for Sylus.

> Sylus: Do you know what I usually see in people's eyes? Greed, envy, lust and desire. But on New Year's Day, they disappear for a few hours. A world without desire means there's no business to be done. So I have time to look around.

> Sylus: Humans are like this. Once they do something one year, they want to keep doing it every year. So greedy. And yet I've become one of them.
