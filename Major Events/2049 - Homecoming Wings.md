| -2 weeks      | [[Zayne]] mentions a "confidential schedule" to MC, which she later learns meant he was also going to [[Skyhaven]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                        |

| +0 days       | [[MC]] heads to [[Skyhaven]] undercover as a [[Farspace Fleet]] officer to investigate the explosion, then learns that [[Caleb]] is alive and the Fleet's new [[Colonel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [[04-01.01 Infiltration]] thru [[04-01.05 Visitation]] |
| +1 days       | [[MC]] heads over to [[Willow Medical Center]] where she runs into [[Zayne]] who helps her talk to [[Mia]] about the explosion.

| +2 days       | [[MC]] seems to be coming down with something, and tries but fails to slip out of [[Caleb's place]]. He seems to drug her so she can't leave, then heads out for a "clean up".                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [[04-01.10 Heart's Crossing]]                          |
| +3 days       | MC wakes to realize she's missed her appointment with [[Kevi]] and [[Zayne]]. Caleb is back and reveals [[Mia]] is dead.

| +4 days       | MC meets [[Kevi]] at [[Lucius's Villa]], overhears [[Caleb]] and [[Professor Lucius]] there, then touches base with the [[Hunters Association]]. That evening, she meets with Caleb at a supernova and gives him [[Caleb's necklace]] embedded with a tracker. That night, she follows him to a "test site" where [[human-like Wanderer]]s are plentiful. This is likely the [[Final Clean-Up]]. | [[04-02.03 Lurking]] thru [[04-02.07 Dark Side]]       |
| +5 days       | Caleb treats MC's wound, but she realizes he has no intention of letting her go. After a failed escape attempt, she's moved to [[Caleb's place]]. They confront each other and Caleb asks for 3 days.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [[04-02.07 Dark Side]] thru [[04-02.09 Captive Bird]]  |
| +8 days       | 3 days later, [[MC]] sees [[Caleb]] off to his mission, as promised. She returns to [[Linkon]]. However, Caleb might not have actually gone to Deepspace...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [[04-02.09 Captive Bird]] thru [[04-02.10 Crossroads]] |
