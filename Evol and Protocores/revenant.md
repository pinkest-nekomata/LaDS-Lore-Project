The souls of the Dead in [[Sindersfell]], akin to ghosts. Xavier's blade can cause them to dissipate, but they reanimate with every cycle of the moon

They're at their strongest at the full moon, and they don't have any true memories of their own, so they only know the stories of [[Philos]]. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 4]])

They're incapable of feeling pain ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 7]]).
