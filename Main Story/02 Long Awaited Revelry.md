*Introduces [[Sylus]]*
# Summary
Searching for the other half of her [[Aether Core]], [[MC]] plunges into the [[N109 Zone]]. Though she's being taken to [[Sherman]]'s branch of [[Onychinus]], [[Sylus]] steps in along with [[Mephisto]], [[Luke and Kieran]] and takes her back to [[Sylus's base]].

Thus begins an antagonistic relationship as [[Sylus]] tries to get [[MC]] to resonate with him. [[Sylus]] uses his eye to stir [[MC]]'s inexplicable desire for his power, prompting flashbacks to [[Beyond Cloudfall]]. They visit [[Philip]] in the [[Odd Workshop]], where it's revealed that [[Philip]] worked on [[Aether Core]]s alongside [[Grandma]].

MC must past two tests--holding her own (while [[Sylus]] uses her as bait) in [[Elysium]], then getting [[Sylus's brooch]] from him ([[Midnight Stealth]]). After she barely passes this test, they head to [[Protocore auction]] where [[Sylus]] kills [[Sherman]] and locates the [[Aether Core]]. 

In a climactic battle at the old [[Ever]] lab on the top of [[Solon Hotel]], the [[Aether Core]] in the [[Flux Nexus]] summons an [[Arbiterwings]] from the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]. It's a tough battle, but [[Sylus]] and [[MC]] succeed. Afterward, [[MC]] has a longer vision of her sword in [[Sylus]]'s chest from [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]], then she's able to resonate with him. This allows her to absorb the [[Aether Core]]'s power, and she now has a complete core.

MC leaves the [[N109 Zone]], but her deal with [[Sylus]] lingers, and she begins to remember glimpses of [[Philos]].

In the arc's final [[cosmic cinematic]], she hears a [[cosmic heartbeat]] at the "confluence of the entwined timelines" and seems to witness Earth cracking apart to become [[Philos]].

## Commentary
The title "Long Awaited Revelry" hints at how long [[Sylus]] has been looking for [[MC]] since the events of [[Beyond Cloudfall]]. The myth is heavily referenced in this arc, and it's the first arc that establishes that Myth events interact with the main timeline.
