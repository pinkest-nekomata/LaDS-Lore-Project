# Summary

# Description

Zayne: After the explosion, your cardiac function index significantly increased. It's most likely a result of the [[Metaflux]]. At least three months of ret and observation are required. But your circumstances called for me to make an exception. Seeing your current state, I regret discharging you early.

MC: I just want to know why the explosion had to happen.

After reviewing the cardiac Evol report, Zayne offers a small electronic box from [[Grandma]] (which contains [[Josephine's notes]]), saying she'd asked him to give it to [[MC]]. He's not sure if it's the right time, but guesses it might have the answers MC seeks.

It opens to her fingerprint and contains a letter:
* Printed: Fluctuations Test Monitor Record
* Handwritten: Subject I-0057

Zayne then sends her to go rest and take care of herself. MC then says something isn't right (because she's sensed a [[Metaflux]] fluctuation). Zayne quickly realizes the danger and tries to hurry her out of the office, but a [[Protofield]] unfurls, drawing them in.
