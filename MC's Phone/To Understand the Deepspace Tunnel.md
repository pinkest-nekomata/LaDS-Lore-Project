> **To Understand the Deepspace Tunnel, Fleet Sets Off**

# Key Info
\[As arranged by the [[Deepspace Aviation Administration]]], "a new Deepspace fleet has embarked on a trip. It consists of one research vessel, two Deepspace probes, and thirteen Deepspacecraft cruisers."

> According to the data sent back so far, as the fleet continues to venture deeper, the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]'s gravity and magnetic fields are changing in tandem with its internal structure. The energy within it is very unstable. Despite this, the research team discovered the energy fluctuations in the tunnel have a striking resemblance to the [[Protofield]]s that we know, but with higher frequencies and larger amplitudes. They are also accompanied by spacetime distortions and space folding. This further suggests the Deepspace Tunnel could be a wormhole capable of connecting two different spacetime regions, and Deepspace signals might reach Earth through it.Â 
> If this hypothesis is proven to be true, while we are currently unable to reach the end of the tunnel, it is believed that, on the other side, there exists a part of the universe we have yet to explore.
