# Summary
[[MC]] accompanies Sylus to a meeting with [[General Rowan]], who's offering a briefcase of gold in exchange for whatever's in Sylus's briefcase. However, it soon becomes clear that Rowan has no intent of having the deal go through--he intends to kill Sylus and take the goods.

As a shootout erupts, [[Kovi]] also appears. [[Sylus]] and [[MC]] make their way to the roof, where Kovi follows, surrounded by henchmen. Thinking he has Sylus backed into a corner, Kovi tries to taunt him. However, Sylus is unfazed as he pulls MC into his embrace--and tips them backwards off the top of the roof.

## Commentary

# Details 
Still in the [[small country in the south]], they head to the outskirts of the city. With a briefcase in hand, they enter the building that appears to be under construction. On the top floor, [[General Rowan]] waits for them in military uniform.

He asks if Sylus brought the goods. Sylus places the briefcase on the table, and Rowan reveals his own briefcase filled with gold bars. Instead of opening his case, Sylus fiddles with a gold bar, commenting on this "old school" way of doing business. Tensions rise. Rowan offers a bottle of wine for [[Sylus]] and [[MC]], saying he's not in a hurry--and calling it a "farewell drink".

Sylus says, "I see. Thank you." Then bullets erupt around them. Sylus kicks the table over, creating cover for him and MC. He also holds her to protect her.

MC is unfazed and readies for the fight, which amuses Sylus. She guesses that there's dozens of people waiting for them--he says there's more than that.

> MC: Surely you have a Plan A, B, C, and D then?
> Sylus: With you here, I only need one.

They fight their way through, pursuing the fleeing [[General Rowan]]. [[Kovi]] appears next to him, adding his own farewell for Sylus.

As more reinforcements pour in, Sylus and MC head for the rooftop.

> MC: I thought you would have reinforcements.
> Sylus: They would only be dead weight.
* ((This speaks to how highly Sylus thinks of MC--and also his initial reluctance to have her tag along. He's used to working by himself--partly because he's powerful enough to do so and it lets him stay agile in his plans.))

Kovi, surrounded by bodyguards, tries to goad Sylus into surrender while he and MC are backed up against the edge of the roof.

> Kovi: Give up now. Then we'll leave your bodies intact.
> Sylus: You're such a disappointment, Kovi. You still haven't figured out whose game we're playing.
> *Sylus's eyes flicker with a dark red glow. He sneaks a glance at me.*
> Sylus: Shall we?
> MC: What?
> *Sylus slightly smiles, pulls me into his embrace, and falls backward.*
> MC: ..!!!
