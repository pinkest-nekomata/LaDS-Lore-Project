[[Sylus]] has been the bar's sponsor and the "powerful force" behind it since only a few months after its founding in 2036.

[[Aislinn]] has worked at the bar since [[Ginevra]] founded it, and has been its primary operator the whole time.

# Name
This is a reference to the Elysium from Greek myth, the place where heroic souls go to rest in peace ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium)). Since it's connected to the afterlife, it's also connected to Hades, who rules the underworld. The parallel to [[Sylus]] ruling the [[N109 Zone]] is clear.

## In CN

CN: 極樂之境
MTL: Paradise
Literally: Land of Extreme Happiness

Notably, the concept of Elysium from Greek myth is usually translated in CN as 至福樂土 (alternatively "The Blessed Land"), 歸靜樂土, or 歸淨樂土 ([Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/至福樂土)) implying that the choice of "Elysium" is primarily part of the localization (Though I am not qualified enough to be confident here). Note the recurrence of 樂 which means happiness/joy and gets elevated to "bliss" with the use of adjectives/adverbs.

# Backstory
*From [[WU-14 Elysium]], see also [[Aislinn#Backstory]]*

Originally founded by [[Ginevra]], an undercover Special Task Force cop. She disappeared a few months after opening it, so it's primarily been run by [[Aislinn]] for its history.

Elysium survived the [[2036 Disaster]] unscathed due a deal [[Ginevra]] made--with the help of [[Phantom Thief Pea]], she procured the [[Protocore map]] that kicked off the gang wars and traded it to [[Sylus]] in exchange for protection of [[Elysium]] and [[Aislinn]]. 

Since the disaster, [[Aislinn]] has operated it as an intel hub. [[Sylus]] has remained the bar's "sponsor" and the "powerful force" behind it. Occasionally, he puts special items on the [[Connoisseur's Menu]] to let [[MC]] know he's waiting for her. ([[Connoisseur's Menu#Today's Special Sweet Evil Trap]])
