[[MC]]'s ankle is sprained by the snare, and [[Xavier]] helps her. He tells her she should leave now that her ankle is injured. In order to try to convince her, he tells her that the forest is alive and has consumed [[Tenebra]]e in the past (see also [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]). It's unclear how many of these statements are true. MC is skeptical.

Xavier leaves and returns to the forest.
