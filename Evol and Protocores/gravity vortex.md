A phenomenon tied to [[Metaflux]] and the [[Deepspace Tunnel]].

After the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], a gravity vortex caused islands to float into the sky, like [[Whirlreef Island]], and these were eventually stabilized to become [[Skyhaven]].

In [[WU-16 Utopian Roamer]], Professor [[Shaylin]]s notes specifically refer to a gravity vortex pulling them through a rift into a [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protofield]].
