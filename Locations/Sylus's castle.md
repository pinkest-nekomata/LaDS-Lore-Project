An abandoned old castle hidden away in the mountains, introduced in [[Valleydream Bloom]]. (See also [[Sylus's nests]].)

May or may not be the same castle as mentioned in [[Midnight Warmth]].

Features:
* Well-equipped with security cameras from the previous hunting games hosted there
* Upper floor had been modified with VIP suites for viewing the games
* Multiple stairways, many corridors
* There's a secret passage on the first floor, activated by a hidden mechanism. This leads to an underground level not otherwise accessible.
