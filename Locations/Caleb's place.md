A spacecraft-shaped building on a floating, fragmented island surrounded by an invisible barrier.

The house is large, with many rooms. It's decorated in muted colors and has a lifeless feeling to it. The in-game background shows mountains visible through large windows.

Much of the house is automated and the curtains/blinds can be controlled via tablet.

Notably, it appears to be separate from [[Skyhaven]]'s other islands and only accessible via aircraft, including the [[Skyhaven shuttle service]].

# Symbolism
Especially as depicted in [[04-01.04 Gentle Gaze]], there's an intentional and eerie symbolism to this house. It's shaped like a space craft, evoking [[Caleb]]'s childhood dreams of being a [[Deepspace Pilot]]. It's isolated on its own small island, separate from the rest of [[Skyhaven]]. And despite Caleb's sunny personality, the interior is decorated in "muted colors" and the place feels empty, bearing a thick layer of dust.

These unsettling juxtapositions mirror Caleb's own unsettling juxtapositions at this point in time. Though he's expressing genuine warmth to MC, there's also a hollowness under it--he's lying to her in some major ways, and attempting to ignore some major issues with the [[Farspace Fleet]] and their recent activities.
