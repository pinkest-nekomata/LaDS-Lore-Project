[[Josephine's notes]] that she left to [[MC]] don't tell the full story--only [[Ever]] now knows these further crucial details.

There are no specific clues as to why [[Grandma]] didn't include these notes in what she left for [[MC]], but given that these detail [[MC]] being intentionally killed by the research time, including Josephine, it's likely that guilt kept her from revealing the full story.
# Summary
The World Underneath story [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust]] provides further details on Josephine's research. Crucially, the [[Aether Core]] was only first seen after an experiment caused [[MC]]'s energy values to spike and cause an explosion. MC was medically dead, but 14 hours later, spontaneously returned to life with the appearance of the unknown substance, dubbed "aether" in her heart.

The researchers decided to "kill" [[MC]] again, and though Josephine was conflicted about it, she didn't stop them (and later regretted this). The same process repeated, with a larger explosion. When MC came back to life, the energy values in her heart were higher. ((The levels reported in [[Josephine's notes]] likely correspond to this phase of the experiment.))

Each time [[MC]] dies, she loses all her memory and cognitive skills and has to relearn them, though she's a particularly fast learner and her abilities quickly surpass those of other children her age. Given how tight the overall timeline is, this happens within days at most.

Before the experiment can continue, the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] occurs. [[MC]] escapes, and Josephine finds her a few days later at the shelter. From here, Josephine decides to take on the responsibility of raising her. MC's memory is unstable, but gradually improves. See also [[MC's memory problems]].

Josephine hopes to check in on the [[Aether Core]] to make sure [[MC]] is actually alright. Notably, the energy value is only half of what it was before the catastrophe, and Josephine wonders if something happened to MC when she was alone in the chaos.

However, Josephine can't get into contact with any of the other researchers. The chaos of the catastrophe has effectively allowed them to escape [[Ever]]'s supervision. Josephine turns to [[Dr. Noah]] for help.

There's a vague reference to another person in the home, which is likely meant to be [[Caleb]].
# Commentary

## Timeline
Clues point at the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] being in the summer, and MC was being experimented on for approx 1.5 months before the catastrophe, so likely late spring/early summer.

MC's first "death" is no more than 7 days before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. Assuming Josephine took 3 days to find her, then her first death would be 5 days before. Her second "death" appears to have occurred right before the catastrophe, as the researchers were able to confirm that she'd resurrected and her energy values were higher, but she was still in the observation unit when the catastrophe occurred. So, a tentative timeline would be (where C is the day of the catastrophe, and OD = Observation Day):
- OD41, C - 5 days: First "death"
- OD42, C - 4 days: First "resurrection"
- OD43-44, recovering cognition ((C-3 days, Polar Night begins ([[Chronorift Catastrophe]])))
- OD45, C - 1 days: Second "Death"
- OD46, C - 0 days: Second "resurrection"
- OD49, C + 3 days: Josephine finds her

About a month (26 days) after they're reunited, Josephine writes an entry about how MC's memory is still shaky. She's forgetting a lot of things, so Josephine has decided to officially take care of her. (There's also a vague reference to [[Caleb]].)

About two months (60 days) after that, so 3mo after the catastrophe, Josephine tries to contact the other researchers, but isn't able to. So she turns to [[Dr. Noah]] for help ensuring that [[MC]]'s heart is stable.

~3 months after that, the [[Hunters Association]] will be founded on January 1st, 2035.

## What we know about the experiments
Comparing these notes to [[Josephine's notes]], we know that the levels must be after MC's first "death" (since the [[Aether Core]] already has a name) but before the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. Since there are only 6 days between MC's first "death" and the catastrophe, and since there are no mentions of MC being "killed" more than twice, the escalating levels in [[Josephine's notes]] are likely from her second "death", where they stimulated the energy to peak.

So, we see from [[Josephine's notes]] that she was asking the other researchers to reconsider "killing" MC, though to no avail.

Side note: Since the discovery of the [[Aether Core]] predates the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], it was called an [[Aether Core]] before [[Protocore]]s had been discovered.

## What MC knows
Though the main story is a bit vague about what was contained in [[Josephine's notes]], the reveal that MC "died" and came back is so important that it's unlikely that [[MC]] knows this information. The existence of the [[Aether Core]] is dangerous enough--knowing that "killing" MC could make her stronger, at the expense of her memories, is information too dangerous for anyone to have, even MC. (Unfortunately, [[Ever]] now knows this since Josephine never destroyed her notes.)

> Subject Anomalies Record
> **Recorder**:
> Josephine, [[Gaia Research Center]], Unicorn Team, Researcher/Team Leader
> **Date**
> Observation No. 5, Day 42
> **Anomalies**
> Subject 001 regained vital signs after death.
> **Details**
> Subject 001: Female, Evol: Anhaunsen Class
> Day 41 of Observation: 2:00 A.M. For reasons unknown (suspected to be a researcher's mishandling of the subject), the subject's energy values rapidly increased and peaked at 2:39 A.M. It resulted in a powerful energy burst within her body (no casualties or equipment was damaged). All vital signs disappeared after the explosion.
> Day 42 of Observation (Today): 4:00 P.M. Vital sign monitors suddenly restarted and slowly transmitted data again. Heart rate, breathing, and brain activity resumed. Not only did Subject 001 appear to be alive again, but energy values also returned to normal.
> A comprehensive physical examination revealed a newly created, unidentified substance in her heart.
> **Experiment Notes**
> Last night's incident... was like watching a planet evolve and be reborn via an explosion. The substance in her heart is composed of an unknown element. We've never seen it before. When the data was released, the team applauded and cheered. But I wasn't as excited as I imagined myself to be. My intense curiosity overshadowed the joy of achievement.
> If she has a "nonexistent element", then what kind of existence is she?
> Outside the observation room, [[Leon]] asked what we should call this element before we had the right to name it. Everyone gathered around him, and "aether" became the most popular, irresistible candidate. Using that, the unidentified object in her heart composed of "aether" was dubbed an "[[Aether Core]]."
> After calming down from the excitement, we began to look at her resurrection. [[Leon]] quietly asked me if this could be considered a "resurrection from death."
> Everyone knew very well that the best way to study her resurrection was to "kill" her again. If she woke up once more, then we could confirm that she's truly a unique miracle of life in this research center.
> She's just like a mythical creature long sought after and believed to exist only in our imagination: a "unicorn".
> A fantastical, beautiful creature.
>
> A box for collecting votes was placed in the corner of the lab. I passed by it several times, unable to give a vote of approval. I know experimentation is a necessary process. She holds too many secrets that are worth researching and carries an unpredictable amount of energy.
> Yet despite my desire for knowledge, I still can't ignore the fact that she's a child.

From [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#03 Observation Log]]
> Observer: Josephine
> Entry No. 1
> "Unicorn" became the child's name in various reports, replacing the cold designation of "Subject 001" (only [[Leon]] insisted on calling her "Little Bomb"). She was like a newborn creature, exploring the world every day using only primitive instincts.
> After her resurrection, her cognition and memory of her previous "life" were erased. To reassess her abilities, I gave her picture books and cards with words. She quickly passed my tests with flying colors, performing better than children at her age. She absorbed and understood information faster and more thoroughly.
> If she were in school, she could easily be a fifth-grade student.
>
> Entry No. 2
> In terms of the [[Evol]] experiment, we could only hypothesize from a numerical perspective. Before she used [[Evol]] of her own accord, no one could be sure how the [[Resonance Evol]] would manifest.
> Only once did she use Resonance unconsciously. The target and range were unclear. [[Leon]] has the [[Acoustic Transmission]] Evol. That day, everyone heard him talking on the phone with his girlfriend as if he were a broadcaster.
> 
> Entry No. 3
> Following the voting results, we began our experiment to kill Unicorn in an observation unit yesterday. We also prepared emergency measures.
> The same situation repeated itself. The energy inside her was stimulated to peak faster than last time, which led to a more intense energy burst. It even spread outside the observation unit. Subsequently, all vital signs disappeared, and she entered a state of "death" as we typically understood it.
> The shrill alarm of the life detector went off, and I realized my right hand had been tightly clutching the back of my left hand. My forehead was also covered in sweat. I was worried the child would never wake up again, but in this research center, being attached to a test subject is prohibited.
> This morning, under the [[Aether Core]]'s influence, she opened her eyes again as expected. [[Leon]] breathed a sigh of relief. So did I.
> I wanted to apologize to the child. But I knew that for her, who had woken up again, the world was a brand new place. She doesn't remember any of us.
> However, what was more intriguing than her blank slate of an emotional state was the [[Aether Core]]'s energy in her heart.
> With the reawakening of her consciousness, it had become stronger.
* ((Given the overall timeline based on the observation days listed, MC is able to recover her cognitive abilities extremely quickly--within days.))

From [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#04 Post-Catastrophe Journal]]
> Day 49, Post-[[Chronorift Catastrophe]], Sunny
> Observations on Unicorn had yet to enter Phase 6 when the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] changed the world.
> The [[Gaia Research Center]] couldn't escape the destruction. When I was rescued from the ruins, the child was nowhere to be seen. She might have escaped when the observation unit was smashed. The [[Evol Police]] who helped in the rescue efforts said they haven't seen the child I described.
> I imagined many possibilities, but I was certain she was alive.
> Days after the disaster, I finally found her in a shelter.
> When I took her hand, I heard her call me "Grandma". I never taught her that term, nor had she ever called me that. She didn't recognize me, either. The days in the research center had once again disappeared from her memory. Yet the seemingly instinctual trust and closeness she showed me made me feel as if those forgotten days were always there, invisibly linking us together.
> I asked her if she wanted to come home with me. She smiled and nodded.
> In the research center, the moment I pushed her into the observation unit felt like a horrible nightmare... Now, holding her soft hand felt like I grasped a redemption bestowed by fate.
>
> Day 75, Post-[[Chronorift Catastrophe]], Sunny
> Our lives have calmed down, yet she still forgets things from time to time. Her memory is like a faint signal, intermittent and sometimes wavering.
> So, I took on the responsibility of a true guardian and cared for her.
> I don't know how to describe my current feelings. I never had children, nor did I ever imagine having relatives. It's always been just me at home. But with her and...
> Things have started to change.
* (("With her and..." is almost certainly a reference to [[Caleb]], who [[Grandma]] also took in at the same time.))

From [[WU-06 Sealed In Dust#05 Journal Entry 4]]:
> Day 134, Post-[[Chronorift Catastrophe]], Sunny
> Her condition has improved a lot recently. She's less likely to forget things. Perhaps it's because her condition is stabilizing. But I'm still worried and want to check her and the [[Aether Core]]. However, I'm unable to contact the researchers who knew of her existence back then, including [[Leon]].
> Strange. Maybe [[Ever]]'s research center called them, or... I don't know.
> Looking back, [[Ever]]'s investment in Gaia wasn't simple research. Our life form observation project was not just for observation. There must be a bigger scheme.
> At this point, the only person who I can turn to is [[Dr. Noah]]. In the field of cardiology, he's the leading expert and the only one I can still trust.
> The data after the checkup shows the energy peak in her heart is only half of what it used to be.
> ... What happened to this child when she faced the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] alone? When I subtly asked her, she just shook her head, showing neither pain nor sadness on her face. Seeing her reaction, I suddenly felt that maybe forgetting isn't such a bad thing for her.
