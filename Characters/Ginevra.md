A key character in [[WU-14 Elysium]]. Ginevra is not her real name, and she was an undercover member of a Special Task Force. In 2036, [[Ginevra]] betrayed the Special Task Force by using the [[Protocore map]] to ensure [[Aislinn]]'s safety and livelihood, then disappeared.

# Backstory
From [[WU-14 Elysium]]
*See also: [[Aislinn#Backstory]]*

When [[Aislinn]] was twelve, [[Ginevra]] adopted her to protect her from Aislinn's abusive father.

In 2036, Ginevra moved to the [[N109 Zone]] to found [[Elysium]], and [[Aislinn]] tagged along. Ginevra frequently met with rough, shady characters and went on dangerous missions that left her bruised. These may have been both official missions as part of the Special Task Force and also personal ones. She mostly kept [[Aislinn]] in the dark.

At the start of the [[2036 Disaster]], [[Ginevra]] betrayed her Special Task Force allies by giving the [[Protocore map]] they'd been searching for to [[Sylus]] in order to protect [[Aislinn]] and secure her future. Then, she disappeared.

# Name
An Italian variation of Guinevere or Jennifer, meaning "white shadow"/"white wave". ([Nameberry](https://nameberry.com/b/girl-baby-name-ginevra))

The Italian origin may be a nod at the Italian mafia, a theme common in the [[N109 Zone]].
