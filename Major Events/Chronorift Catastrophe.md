> "I still remember that from fourteen years ago. It was also a lively evening. The roars of Wanderers, like a flood, drowned out the screams and cries for help. I sprint through the street covered in rubble, not even knowing what monster is chasing me. Until a sharp pain pierces me and burrows itself into my heart.
> A makeshift shelter made of the remains of collapsed buildings is within sight. Trembling, I muster all the strength I have and crawl toward it. Amidst the dirt and gloom, a small seedling breaks through the soil. If I survive this, I don't want to be anyone's prey. I don't want to only run when there's danger..."

# Spacepedia
Fourteen years ago, with the opening of the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], countless [[Wanderer]]s invaded Earth and began attacking humans. Many lives were lost. Among the affected areas, [[Linkon]] City suffered the highest number of casualties.

# Other Info

## Companion Interactions
* [[Xavier]], as [[Lumiere]], saved [[MC]] from a [[Wanderer]] with a beam of light. ([[01-06.01 Legendary Lumiere]])
* [[Zayne]] briefly met [[MC]] at the shelter and made her a popcicle, though she forgot about this. (citation #todo, this is in a Zayne memory where they go try to get nostalgic snacks)
* [[Caleb]] finds [[MC]] at the shelter, and realizes she's forgotten him again. He re-introduces himself. (citation #todo)

**Notes**
* Chrono = time, so this is a "time rift" catastrophe. Central to the themes of [[spacetime]] disturbances and [[converging timelines]]
