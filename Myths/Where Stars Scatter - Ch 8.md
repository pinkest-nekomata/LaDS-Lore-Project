# Summary
MC recaps what she's learned about the events of [[Shooting Stars]] and [[Xavier]] returning to find her gone, then taking the throne.

We return to the monastery where [[Xavier]] confronts the [[Bishop]] over what happened to the [[Sinders]] river, revealing that the Bishop and his allies (who run the [[Great Pilgrimage]]) have royal blood and have been intentionally feeding [[revenant]]s to the core. The Bishop also reveals that sacrificing [[Chosen One MC]] will allow the planet to live, but [[Xavier]] can also take her place.

[[Xavier]] and [[Chosen One MC]] return to the garden with the [[forget-me-nots]], where the single flower still hasn't bloomed. Xavier names his horse [[Shadowbind]], then they go for a ride into the countryside. They spar, echoing [[Shooting Stars]]. It becomes a warm moment with a gentle forehead kiss.

They return to the castle. Xavier puts her in bed as exhaustion overwhelms her, agreeing when she says they'll see each other tomorrow. As she drifts off, he adds that he recognized her the moment he saw her, and "When you return to Philos and see I'm not there, will you be angry that I deceived you again?" He adds that there's a spaceship docked at the northern edge of [[Starfall Forest]] ready to take her to [[Xavier and MC's little planet]], if she wants.

She wakes in the boat with the ferryman, with blurred memories, unsure how she got there. She still has the [[Protocore]] fragment (aka "shiny pebble") and it responds to her power. She finds a radiance and responds to it, finding an enormous tree made of energy. The trees voice guides her to return to "where everything began."

The tree reveals that [[Sindersfell]] is a timeline branch that was never meant to be, and offers MC a chance to go back in time and perhaps find a different fate for [[Philos]], one that doesn't require hers or Xavier's sacrifice. However, it will cause this current world to collapse. (See below.) MC chooses to go back in time, and then emerges from the cave, realizing that the ferryman is her and Xavier's teacher from [[Shooting Stars]]. He says he's always been proud of her, then walks into the river, leaving her the boat.

[[Shadowbind]] is waiting, and takes [[MC]] to [[Xavier]] back at [[Sindersfell]].

## Commentary

# Details

MC's recap at the start of the chapter:
> I've seemingly grasped a crucial thread as forgotten memories begin to surface.
> Xavier is the king who succeeded me after I disappeared.
> The truth is right before my eyes. This place isn't so different from [[Philos]]. Or rather, places where "humans" exist are very similar to one another.
> But if l've been in the heart of the planet for years...
> Then what did Xavier experience? Why is he even here?
> Little by little, I pieced together the truth from the forgotten tombstones scattered across [[Sindersfell]].
> The story continues. While I was gone, my knight traversed the starry sea.
> My knight put on that dust-covered crown.
> My knight became their king.
> It's the most magnificent coronation ceremony in the history of Philos.
> His decisions and achievements sent echoes throughout the cosmos. Enduring the test of time, they had spread far and wide.
> The people gathered in the square. Bathed in the sun's brilliant radiance, they danced to the rhythm of drums and wind instruments until midnight.
> Only when the radiant moon hung high, its light making the city walls the color of bones, did he finally leave the courtyard.
> Still wearing white coronation robes, the king removed his crown. Akin to a god's merciful gaze, moonlight poured through the dome and washed over him.
> Did he sleep well? What happened in his dream?
> `Xavier's voice can be heard sighing and saying, "I miss you so much."`
> After that, my knight picked up his sword. Monsters and rebels fell one after another to his blade. A new world order was established.
> Following centuries of war and chaos, [[Philos]] was ushered in a dreamy golden age.
> They adored and praised him. The ballads spoke of his wisdom and brilliance. All knights swore their loyalty to him. He was given the title "[[Sentinel of the Stars]]." Yet in the end, they stormed his castle and held swords to his throat.
> Knowledge was lost, the world order crumbled, and war raged endlessly. He sat on his throne as a prisoner. Alone, he bore the weight of his crown.
> This was the downfall of Philos, and the story of his life.

MC has a conversation with the tree:
> MC: Who are you...?
> Tree: Our fates are similar. And yet they are different. I sensed your presence when you entered the [[Heart of the Planet]].
> MC: (The [[Heart of the Planet]]...l feel like I know that place very well.)
> Tree: You must be feeling very confused right now. Wherever there is light, the shadow must follow. And together they'll coexist. Likewise, [[Sindersfell]] is the shadow of [[Philos]]. ...It is also a failed possibility that continues to expand.
> MC: So Sindersfell is heading towards its destruction, too? Why am I here, then...?
> Tree: Just like how you saved Philos, you possess the power to save the city of revenants.
> *Old memories wash over me. I sat on the throne and waited for a long, long time.*
> *But my knight never returned to me.*
> *They told me the only way to save this planet is for me to walk into the Heart of the Planet.*
> *But if I willingly became nourishment for Philos, then why do I still feel pain and loneliness?*
> *Was I not prepared to be sacrificed? Was I waiting for someone to find me?*
> *But this time, I refuse to repeat the same mistake.*
> MC: I refuse to be Philos's salvation, and I refuse to be everyone's hope. The Chosen One is nothing more than a tool for selfish people who want to keep their immortality. Be it in Philos or in this city of revenants—it's all the same
> Tree: `(sighs)` You are correct. Philos's destruction cannot be prevented. There was once a king. When he was still a knight, he reached the same conclusion. To truly save those trapped in eternity, one must return to the correct divergence point and create new possibilities. The current Sindersfell is but a false branch. It's a tributary destined to run dry
> MC: Are you talking about... going back in time? When is the correct divergence point?
> *She lets out a soft sigh.*
> Tree: The two of you chose different methods to save the planet. Neither was right nor wrong... But salvation should never be achieved through sacrifice. The path of Backtracking is dangerous. Success is far from guaranteed.

> *I remember him bidding me farewell in the empty palace. His lonely figure walked away from the royal court.*

> *From that moment, the two of us and the planet we inhabited created different tributaries of fate.*

> Tree: The [[Aether Core]] within you shares the same origin as this planet. Its power is from the depths of the cosmos. The Protocore will mend the fractures in this world and allow that eternal city to become a reality. Before its power is depleted, it can grant you one last choice. You can return to the divergence point he created... Or remain in this false Philos. However, I must warn you. If you choose to return to the past, this world will immediately "collapse." Philos's fate might find a new hope. Or it will march toward irreversible destruction once more. Even you shall become an unknown variable. Have you decided?
> MC: I want to go back.
