[[Thomas]] learns that it's [[Rafayel]]'s insistence on creating his own pigments that makes his work so priceless
## Summary
[[Thomas]] learns that what makes [[Rafayel]]'s works so priceless and unique is his insistence on creating his own pigments for his paint, ensuring that they're truly one-of-a-kind.

We also learn that [[Thomas]] used to be an artist, and that's how he first met [[Rafayel]]. After being impressed by Rafayel's talent, he went to business school specifically to become Rafayel's manager.
# 01 Unfinished Work
[[Thomas]] is preparing for [[Rafayel]]'s next art exhibition. There's a blank space waiting for [[Rafayel]]'s "magnum opus", but only [[Thomas]] knows it's not finished yet.

[[Rafayel]] is procrastinating by building towers of tiny fish bones. [[Thomas]] is stressing over having already promised the sponsors that the piece would be done in time. 

[[Rafayel]] agrees to let [[Thomas]] see the WIP, and Thomas thinks it's already perfect. However, Rafayel insists it's missing a color, threatening to burn the painting if Thomas tries to take it to the exhibition anyway. Thomas's compromise is to give Rafayel a three day deadline.

# 02 Missing Color
Three days later, [[Thomas]] finds [[Rafayel]] on the beach near [[Rafayel's house (Mo Art Studio)]], drawing in the sand because he still can't find the color. [[Thomas]] offers to take Rafayel to his friend's pigment factory, but Rafayel is offended--those colors have already been used by other people, so Rafayel will never use them. Thomas wistfully remembers how similar this is to when they first met.

# 03 Passionate Colors
[[Thomas]]'s painting is displayed alongside [[Rafayel]]'s at a charity event. Though they're similar works, and Thomas initially thinks his is better, everyone who approaches only looks at Rafayel's. Thomas thinks it's just because of the hype, but then a famous art collector stops by and tells Thomas that Rafayel's painting has "passionate color", whereas in Thomas's, "the red's off."

# 04 Carefree Painter
[[Thomas]] goes to visit [[Rafayel]] and meet him for the first time. Rafayel is aloof and carefree, not caring how much his painting sells for as long as it went to charity. Thomas asks what brand of paint Rafayel uses, and he's stunned, revealing that he makes all his pigments himself. When Thomas offers fame in exchange for information on how he makes his colors, Rafayel replies, "I don't paint for fame."

Returning to the present, Thomas muses on how he's believed in Rafayel from that day forward, studying business just to become Rafayel's manager. Just as he's encouraging Rafayel that he won't be stopped by artist's block, he realizes that Rafayel has already walked away up the beach.

# 05 Drastic Measures
With two days left until the exhibition, [[Thomas]] tries to steal the work in progress--only for [[Rafayel]] to catch him and nearly set fire to the painting. Rafayel sleeps in the studio for the rest of the night to protect the painting. In the morning, [[Thomas]] finds him with an unusual conch shell--which will finally provide the color he needs.

Thomas is elated--until [[Rafayel]] reveals that it'll take at least three days just to get the color extracted. Thomas finally gives up. Though he calls Rafayel the night before the exhibition, the ten calls go unanswered and Thomas uses his backup plan.

# 06 A Unique Legend
Three days after the exhibition ends, [[Rafayel]] is in the studio with a pile of conch shells and a new color on his palette. [[Thomas]] tells him he's off the hook--he hung an empty frame, gave it a strange name, and that was that. The critics were deeply impressed. "Maybe I still have some artistic talent in me," Thomas muses.

Rafayel ignores him, too absorbed in adding the conch's reddish-purple color to the painting. Thomas confesses he can't tell the difference between this and the factory-made claret violet. Rafayel insists this is actually Tyrian purple, and it took "ten thousand conches to get one gram."
* This is a real color ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_purple)) though notably, the color comes not from the shell itself, but from the snail's mucous, so the snail must be alive when it's collected. As mentioned in the anecdote, the rarity of this die did contribute to the concept of "royal purple".
* Claret violet is also a real color, part of the RAL colour standard. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RAL_colours#RAL_4004))

Rafayel reminds Thomas of when he was trying to find a vermillion that could match Rafayel's. ((This is likely the red referenced above.)) Thomas never could mix a comparable color: "A unique vermillion... does that even exist?" (Hence the name of the anecdote.) Thomas elaborates the vermillion used to be collected from insects (this is accurate, ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion))) but it can now be synthesized, making it more accessible.

Rafayel counters that when it's synthesized, every batch uses the same chemicals. This creates a set of "rules" that confine the artist. The colors lose their unique origins--that is, their tie to the specific conch or specific bug that helped create them.

It finally clicks for Thomas. Historic paintings are valuable because of their scarcity, and the same is true of their color. In essence, no two bugs produce the same vermillion. Even if it's similar, it's still fundamentally unique. Thomas muses, "There's nothing more precious than being one of a kind in this world."

When the painting is finally exhibited, another young painter expresses similar skepticism to what Thomas once had. Thomas comes to Rafayel's defense, sharing how this purple was extracted from thousands of conches, which makes the shade fantastical and makes Rafayel legendary.
