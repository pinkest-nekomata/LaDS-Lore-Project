"I press my thumb down on the lock, and Grandma's box opens with a light, mechanical click. The lamp on the desk shrines over yellowed papers. The ones at the top of the pile appear to contain experimental data with diagrams." -- [[01-05.01 Unspoken Secret]]

"Fusing a protocore with a human heart? Why did [[Grandma]] have records about an illegal experiment like this..." -- [[01-05.01 Unspoken Secret]]

Zayne gives [[Grandma]]'s box, which contains these notes, to MC in [[01-04.10 Secret]] and she examines the contents in [[01-05.01 Unspoken Secret]].

> Observation Log: The subject's heart has been stable for the past 72 hours. Preliminary assessments indicate fusion with the [[Aether Core]] was successful.
> 
> AC Fluctuation Test No.1: The energy fluctuation value of the Aether Core has reached Level II. The subject's heart is stable.
>
> AC Fluctuation Test No.2: The energy fluctuation value of the Aether Core has reached Level III. The subject's heart is stable.
>
> *The next few sheets report similar data. The last sheet, however, is handwritten instead of typed.*
> 
> AC Fluctuation Test No.12: The energy fluctuation value of the Aether Core has reached Level VII. The subject is showing abnormal signs... Warning! Stop it!!!
