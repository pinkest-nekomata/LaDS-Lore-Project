# Summary

After [[MC]] helps [[Rafayel]] get a [[Protocore]] from the [[Deluge Wyrmlord]], he gives her what he promised--a way into the [[N109 Zone]]. The mysterious [[Hunting Day]] and [[The Nest]] will be a chance for her to dangle herself as bait in front of those after the coveted [[Aether Core]]s.

The day before [[Hunting Day]], MC scopes out [[The Nest]] and is surprised to find [[Xavier]] there. He's in the area after dealing with one of the traitor [[Backtrackers]], and he's clearly familiar with the workings of [[The Nest]]. Upon seeing [[MC]], he asks her to follow him out of [[The Nest]] on instinct.

[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] make it to [[Azure Square]], then briefly discuss the fact that [[MC]] has decided to go into the [[N109 Zone]]. Once they realize they're being watched by [[patrol robot]]s, Xavier and MC resonate and Xavier creates an opportunity to cut down all the bots without alerting the crowd. 

From there, he takes MC to the flower shop [[Philo]] so she can meet [[Jeremiah]] and get a fake identity that will help her survive in the [[N109 Zone]]. He also provides her an assortment of tools to help her survive: [[inhibitor pill]]s, a [[secret transmitter]], and a [[liquid-filled needle]].

MC is suspicious of Xavier's connections, and once she leaves, a scene between [[Xavier]] and [[Jeremiah]] reveals that they're semi-immortals from elsewhere (([[Philos]])) and their presence on Earth at this time is a mistake.

Back at her apartment, [[MC]] goes over everything she's learned, preparing for the next stage of her plan. She knows that [[Onychinus]] has an [[Aether Core]] which will be featured at the upcoming [[Protocore auction]], and she wants it, hoping it will have answers about her past. In order to get it, she'll offer up her own [[Aether Core]] as bait so that she can get taken into the [[N109 Zone]].

With [[Rafayel]]'s help, [[MC]]'s plan to get captured goes off without a hitch. During the [[Hunting Day]], she sees a spherical droid that looks just like [[the giant red eye]] she saw before, and it identifies her as the target for the hunt.

Once MC is captured as planned, another scene reveals [[Rafayel]] watching the events while discussing his own deal with the [[mysterious Ever representative]]. Though it may seem like he's sending [[MC]] to her death, he expresses doubt that [[Ever]] will be able to handle her.
