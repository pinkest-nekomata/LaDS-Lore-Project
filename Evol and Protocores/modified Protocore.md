A theme linking [[Onychinus]] (especially under [[Sherman]]) and [[Ever]].

The first modified [[Protocore]] is recovered from the [[Flux Nexus]] in [[No-Hunt Zone 7]] during [[01-03.06 Awakened Forest]].

> 3019.9 eV. The [[Protocurve]] of that [[Protocore]] and the energy value in its ground state is close to the energy value of the [[Aether Core]] in my heart. Meanwhile, the energy value for ordinary [[Protocore]]s is around 2500 eV. (This can't be a coincidence. That [[Protocore]] is a result of [[Onychinus]] using an [[Aether Core]] to modify it.)

* Notably, we can infer that the curves are so similar because the modification was done with the "other half" of MC's [[Protocore]], as [[Philip]] reveals in [[02-01.08 Hesitation]].

Similarly modified Protocores also appear in [[03-01.02 New Discovery]], though these are modified by the [[Spatium Core]], not the other half of [[MC]]'s [[Aether Core]].
