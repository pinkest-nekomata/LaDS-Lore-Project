> "To see the sunrise, this bird can endure so much... I aspire to be like that."
> --MC, [[Perfect Sunset]]

A sci-fi novel MC read in high school during her lunch breaks. She wasn't able to read the second half until finding the book later at a used book store owned by [[Xavier]]'s friend. It's an old book--older than MC. ([[Perfect Sunset]])

**Premise:** 
> MC: The protagonist is a lonely bird, one without any companions. It lives on a barren planet, fighting to survive every day.

> MC: This book begins with a prologue about the sunset before the long polar night. The bird dreamed of seeing the sunrise again after surviving the night.

**Quotes:**
> Xavier: "It perches atop the glacier and gazes up at the sky-there is nothing, only darkness, day after day. The world is veiled in perpetual darkness, without any sign of life. Its nest has crushed under the weight of yesterday's snow, and it must now find a new place to live as soon as possible. The blizzard won't let up once it hits. It must move faster."

> MC: "That was a beautiful sunset I just watched. The sunrise must be equally breathtaking to witness," said the bird. There is a similarity in what you just said.
