## Commentary

### Dragon Core
The Spacepedia entry is from MC's perspective, so it may not be strictly accurate that his eye's power is an Aether Core like hers; Sylus is a bit noncommittal when she mentions his eye being an Aether Core, saying "let's call it that" ( #todo citation). 

Given that an "Aether Core" is essentially any particularly powerful Protocore, there's no real contradiction here, but there's reason to avoid generalizing Sylus's abilities to other Aether Cores. 

Notably, Dragon Cores are a type of core in [[Xianxia]], and Sylus is a dragon, so it'd be his Dragon Core. By contrast, [[MC]]'s [[Aether Core]] moreso fits the type of a "Cultivated Core".
