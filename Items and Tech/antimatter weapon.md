One of the few classes of weapon that can nullify [[Sylus]]'s [[Evol]] and present a risk to him.

In [[05-01.05 Join the Game]], when struck with an antimatter weapon, Sylus's mist dissipates and his wound doesn't heal immediately as it normally would.

Sylus is dismissive of their threat, calling them "cheap knockoffs".
