# Summary
After boxing, [[Sylus]] and [[MC]] eat dinner together, as delivered to them by a dedicated chef. MC shamelessly orders lots of food, and Sylus subtly eggs her on, ordering all the desserts when she can't pick one.

It's revealed that observing MC is part of Sylus's daily routine, and she's got her own observational skills in return--since Sylus is always planning ahead, of course he'd notice the little details that others miss.

## Commentary
### Stoking desires
Here, we see Sylus encouraging MC's desires in a much more subtle way than he did in [[02-01.05 Desire]]. He asks her sincerely what she wants, and doesn't tease her at all for ordering so much. When she can't decide on dessert, he orders them all.
### Observing MC
Sylus hints that observing MC is part of his everyday life. He notices little things--like how she looks different when she eats different kinds of food (after teasing her that she looked like a hamster). She has her own observational skills, noting that in order to stay ten steps ahead, he'd need to notice the little things others miss. It's subtle, but this observation seems to surprise and impress Sylus, earning her a genuine compliment.

# Details

While MC is showering, she realizes she didn't bring a change of clothes. But Sylus knocks on the door, telling him clothes are nearby for her to get for herself when she's ready.

MC's confused when she gets dressed, as the clothes are the same ones she arrived in--he bought her another set of all the same items.

> MC: But you were boxing with me the whole time. When did you...
> Sylus: If I didn't anticipate every possible outcome of an event, I wouldn't be where I am now.

Meanwhile, Sylus is reading an intel report printed like a newspaper, full of jaw-dropping information. A chef checks in, offering lobster, salmon tartare, and stuffed steak rolls. Sylus softly asks what MC would like. Hungry from boxing, she shamelessly orders a lot of food, which turns out to be delicious. 

Sylus asks about dessert. The chef offers red wine ice cream, vanilla cheese pudding, and almond cake with grapefruit sorbet. When MC isn't sure which one to get, Sylus orders them all.

> MC: You're like me. After eating something salty, you want something sweet. And then you want something salty again.
> Sylus: I feel like you're describing a hamster's eating habits.
> MC: But I'm not a hamster...
> Sylus: Hamsters are constantly eating, and they all look the same while doing so. You, on the other hand, look different when eating various kinds of food.
> MC:  I'm the one who wanted to be let into your life. How did it become you observing me?
> Sylus: This is also part of my everyday life.
> MC: True... People who can think ten steps ahead can also see the details most would overlook.
> *Sylus slightly narrows his eyes and scoops up some red wine ice cream to eat.*
> Sylus:  Miss Hunter, your observation skills aren't bad either.
