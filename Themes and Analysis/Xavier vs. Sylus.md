[[Xavier]] and [[Sylus]] are both otherwordly and immortal beings with unusually strong Evols who originate from [[Philos]] and cross space and time to find [[MC]]. Xavier is a noble Knight/Prince with light-themed powers who tragically makes promises to MC that he cannot keep. Sylus is an "evil" Dragon with dark/demon-themed powers who always keeps his promises.

# Shared traits
* From [[Philos]] (and the future)
* Effectively immortal
* Light-haired
* Traveled across space and time to find [[MC]]
	* Specifically, traveled back in time
	* Xavier traveled via the [[Traceback II]] and the [[Deepspace Tunnel]]
	* It's reasonable to assume that Sylus's journey on his personal ship also used the [[Deepspace Tunnel]], though perhaps with access to better tech than [[Xavier]]'s crew, since [[Sylus]] is likely from a further future age on [[Philos]], given that immortality doesn't seem to be common anymore
* Unusually powerful and rare Evols
* God-like theming
	* Xavier with the sleepy god trope
	* Sylus with the dragon god trope
* Odd sleeping habits/sleeping during the day
* Odd/modified sense of taste
	* Xavier with his acclimation to Philosian food
	* Sylus with a dragon's muted sense of taste
