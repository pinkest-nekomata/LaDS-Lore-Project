> The night shift at the inpatient building is like a giant circulatory system. Blood and breath move silently through the halls. Souls slumber in the small, white cubes lining the corridors. Greyson feels like he's gone adrift, a lone white blood cell wandering a weary body. And the only beacon in the night? Zayne's office, of course.
> The ever-vigilant lighthouse keeper guards the shores of life. Does even he feel the weight, the helplessness?

## Freezing over?
[[Zayne's Trailer]] mentions the "original location" of [[Akso Hospital]] freezing over. This is perhaps mirrored or foreshadowed in [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon - 12]] when MC and Zayne freeze the [[Wanderer]] [[Protofield]] to drive it out, effectively icing over all of Akso Hospital. It's unclear whether this event already happened at another location, or is expected to happen in the future. ((It seems slightly more likely this is a past event, especially as Zayne says he hopes they don't meet again.))
