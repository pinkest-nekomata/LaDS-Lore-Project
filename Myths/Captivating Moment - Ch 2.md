# Summary

We're introduced to [[Sylus's luxury suite]], which takes up the top two floors of the hotel. It's clear that this is a permanent arrangement, and [[MC]] quips "A crow has three nests" to which [[Sylus]] agrees he has more than just the two residences. ((This on top of his other satellite locations, as seen in [[Greedy Heart]] and other memories.))

After choosing a bedroom, MC doesn't see Sylus so she explores and finds a boxing gym. Sylus finds her there and they spar. This is the Kindled scene of [[Captivating Lesson]]. Sylus seems pleasantly surprised by her abilities and quick learning. She says he's a good teacher, and he replies that it depends on who he's teaching.

## Commentary
### A side of you only I know
This is the theme of this Myth, as established in the description, and it really starts to show itself here. MC compliments Sylus on being a good teacher, and he says it "depends on who I'm teaching". That is, he already recognizes that MC brings this side out of him. It clearly comes naturally to him, but is still something he doesn't really get a chance to show other people (except [[Luke and Kieran]], to some extent).

# Details

The car arrives at the underground parking garage of the hotel containing [[Sylus's luxury suite]]. (See also [[Sylus's nests]].) MC is surprised and they banter about it.

> MC: Don't you live in that base?
> Sylus: Is a person forced to have only one residence?
> MC: ...No?
> Sylus: Exactly.
> MC: ...A crow has three nests.
> Sylus: I can confirm there are more than two, sweetie.
> *Although Sylus's words sound quite arrogant, the calm expression on his face makes it seem like this is the norm for him.*
> *I take a deep breath, quietly reminding myself not to be too surprised.*
> MC: Just live how you always do. Don't hold back because of me. Treat me like...
> *Mephisto, the crow with mechanical wings, lands on Sylus's shoulder. He lets out a cheerful cry.*
> MC: Silent Crow No. 2. Even if you're up to no good, I won't tell anyone.
> Sylus: One talkative voice is enough.

Once MC picks her bedroom (implying there are several guest rooms available) she doesn't see Sylus so she explores the rest of the suite, stopping in the boxing ring to train for a bit.

Upon finding her, Sylus says:
> I see I didn't need to tell you to make yourself at home.

He asks if she knows how to box, and she reveals that she learned the basics at the [[Hunters Academy]].

> MC: ...Are you going to spar with me?
> Sylus: I mean, hitting a punching bag by yourself is boring.
> *Sylus steps into the boxing ring. He looks relaxed compared to me who's itching for a fight.*
> Sylus: Relax. We're just sparring.
> MC: Sure, but who knows if you're going to secretly keep track of our score and get revenge on me if I win.
> *Sylus puts on his boxing hand wraps.*
> Sylus: Oh, right. How you perform should be a factor in whether or not you can sit in the jet.
> MC: You...! I won't give you a chance to refuse.
> Sylus: We'll see, sweetie.

Sylus starts mostly on the defensive, though MC notes that "his speed and reaction time are on the level of a professional." She's tired out before she can land a hit. MC complains about this, to which Sylus offers constructive guidance. 

> MC: How are you able to move so quickly?
> Sylus: You're leaning too much. Also, your elbows aren't tucked in correctly. That affects how good your punches are. Look at the mirror.
> *On the opposite side of the room is a full-length mirror. I see Sylus and myself in its reflection.*
> Sylus: Keep your center of gravity around your core.
> *Sylus lightly presses down on my shoulder and shifts my balance back*.
> Sylus: When you punch, you need to follow the flow. Move your shoulder forward.
> *With Sylus behind me, he leans down and holds my hands.*
> Sylus: Like this. When your elbow goes past 90 degrees, move your arm in. Don't force it. Let your fist naturally rotate.
> *He gently grips my hand and slowly demonstrates how to punch. With our skin touching and the strength in his hand, I tense my back and arm.*
> Sylus: You keep lowering your head. You're not going to beat up a kid, right?
> *He lifts my chin, his voice right next to my ear.*
> Sylus: Raise your head. Look at the mirror.
> *I have no choice but to do as he says. I glance at our reflection, and it's as if Sylus is holding me in his arms. My ears are slightly red.*
> MC: Alright... I'll show you what I can do.

They spar, as depicted in the [[Captivating Lesson]] Kindled scene, with mini-games. Sylus's banter changes based on the player's timing, and overall he's pleasantly surprised by [[MC]]'s abilities. She manages to get his arm behind his back with a sneak attack, but it's revealed he let her get away with it when he warns her to keep her guard up and pins her to the mat.

((After the Kindled scene, the music that plays is called 'Talented Hunter' on the OST, so it's very fitting.))

> Sylus: You're pretty talented, I have to say.
> MC: Well, you're pretty good at teaching.
> Sylus: You think so?
> *Unable to understand why he's smiling, I look at him.*
> Sylus: It depends on who my student is.
