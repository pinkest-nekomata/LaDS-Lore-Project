> "Rafayel, 24 years old. An artist who returned to the country at the start of this year. He's a once-in-a-century genius... [...] He's an odd one. No one knows his background or his hometown. He rarely interacts with other artists."

* #todo If we can figure out how long Rafayel has been back in Linkon, we can determine the season. The records say he returned "Not too long ago"

> "Industry insiders say Rafayel locks himself in his studio for half the year, then spends the rest of his time traveling the world for inspiration. As for his paintings... Just last month, his art broke the record for highest selling price at [[Lizio Auctions]]!"

# Relationship Timeline

( #todo add their childhood meeting that MC forgot)

MC first meets him as an adult in [[01-01.07 Ripples]].

Then a day later in [[01-02 The First Mission]], she investigates the painting of his that [[Raymond]] bought, and visits his studio.

Based on their conversation in [[01-07.04 Under The Waves]], she'd forgotten about their bodyguard arrangement at this point. This implies that in the main story timeline, any memories in which Rafayel refers to their bodyguard arrangement would be after [[01-07.04 Under The Waves]], and so also over 6mo after [[Grandma]]'s death. Alternatively, she may have forgotten multiple times.

# Trivia
* Despite being a [[Lemuria]], [[Rafayel]] easily gets seasick ([[01-07.05 Set Sail]]) and motion sick ([[Intertidal Zone]]).
* Like a true fishie, he's afraid of cats. ([[01-07.08 Weak Fiends]])
