A recurring theme across myths.

"Heart arrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions, heart murmurs... Despite being aware of the risks, you still became a hunter." -- [[Zayne]], [[01-01.08 Doctor]]
* heart arrhythmia is simply a fast or slow heart rate, so this relates to him teasing her about her heart being fast when he's examining her.
* premature ventricular contractions can also describe a fluttering sensation, or "heart skipping a beat"
* hear murmurs are extra sounds that can be harmless or indicate a serious problem, depending. they come from turbulent blood flow.
* ((This could also be interpreted as Zayne teasing her, as these heart conditions can relate to romance tropes.))
