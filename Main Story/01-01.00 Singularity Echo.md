> Day 1326 
> Attention: Target Anchor Lost
> No response from base.
> [[Traceback II]] is about to pass the event horizon and enter the [[black hole]].
> `The ship drifts past the planet, and in the distance, light spirals around a dark circle. The screen goes black.`
> We are stuck in this loop... 
> `A small light pulses in the dark between these lines of text.`
> This never-ending journey...
* ((See also [[time loop]], refer to [[cosmic cinematic]] for full commentary))

A radio broadcast plays, introducing the setting.
* [[Xavier]] defeats a [[Wanderer]] with his light blade.
* [[Zayne]] is driving to work.
* [[Rafayel]] is napping on the couch while working on a painting.

Final line of the broadcast:
> ...we can pass through the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] and discover the future awaiting us.

Other notes:
* References hunters who've recently passed the [[Hunter Exam]]
* Kinda looks like spring/summer? But only vague seasonal clues
