If there is a chaotic [[Protofield]] and frequent [[Wanderer]] appearances, the [[Hunters Association]] will designate the area as a no-hunt zone. Citizens are prohibited from entering. Hunters are also not allowed to enter without official authorization. Most of these areas were greatly affected during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] 14 years ago. The most hellish of battles took place in them, and the impact of the Catastrophe continues to this day.

* [[No-Hunt Zone 7]]
