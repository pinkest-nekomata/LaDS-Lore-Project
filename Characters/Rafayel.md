MC first meets him in [[01-01.07 Ripples]].

"He's pretty famous, always on the news. Probably why you've heard of him before." -- [[Tara]], [[01-02.06 Next Target]]

"Rafayel, 24 years old. An artist who returned to the country at the start of this year. He's a once-in-a-century genius... [...] He's an odd one. No one knows his background or his hometown. He rarely interacts with other artists." -- [[MC]] reading a data packet from [[Tara]] in [[01-02.06 Next Target]]
* #todo If we can figure out how long Rafayel has been back in Linkon, we can determine the season. The records say he returned "Not too long ago"

"Industry insiders say Rafayel locks himself in his studio for half the year, then spends the rest of his time traveling the world for inspiration. As for his paintings... Just last month, his art broke the record for highest selling price at [[Lizio Auctions]]!" -- [[Tara]], [[01-02.06 Next Target]]
