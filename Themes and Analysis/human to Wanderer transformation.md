> It wore human clothing and bore a human-like visage, but its veiny skin grotesquely bulged. Its pupils glowed a sinister, unnatural blue; its aura was anything but human.

> Then I hear the crackling of something burning. Yet the figures don't cry out. They don't even stop for a second.
> Amidst the blue firelight, I see their faces--Under the corroded, crystallized skin, they seem to have human faces... They resemble humans more than [[Wanderer]]s.*

In the [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] timeline, humans in the midst of transforming are called [[Abomination]]s, and this is a useful term for the phenomenon more broadly.

# Circumstances
> "After that incident, we learned that under extremely special circumstances--When [[Wanderer]]s strike, their attacks cause energy crystals to grow in the afflicted area. They corrode the human body and grow a sort of "shell" over it. Once that happens, the victims can lose their sanity within seconds and uncontrollably lash out at anyone around them."

# Transformation
[[Never-Ending Winter#05 A Long Way Home]] and [[Never-Ending Winter#06 The Nightmare Worsens]] describe [[William]]'s transformation in detail:
> "What is it?" William turns around.
> Unable to speak, Zayne points.
> Confused, William looks down.
> An eerie blue glow appears on his chest. Crystals, beautiful and sinister, slowly begin to spread. [...]
> "What is this?"
> Suspicious, [[William]] touches them. He finds the fine [[black crystals]] are now growing on his hand and sting. He tries to wipe them off, fling them off, even use his [[Evol]] to get rid of them. The crystals continue to grow. [...]
> It all happens so suddenly.
> The crystals accumulate, and Wiliam's expression goes from surprised to panicked. "W-what's going on?!"
> But the crystals don't give him any time to react. Within seconds, his limbs corrode, twisting into uncomfortable, strange positions. The air around him explodes. [...] His bones and muscles are torn and start to dissolve. he cries out in pain.
> [...] The crystals, consuming bone, devouring marrow, climb to his neck. HIs arms, moving on their own, attack [[Zayne]]. William watches with dread as his body becomes twisted and gnarled.
> "It's already too late... Kill me!"
> [...] The tissue underneath the crystals rapidly forms a strange shell. [...] Crystals have encased William's body, leaving only his eyes, which stare at Zayne with a mix of pain and hope.

# Luke and Kieran
It's worth noting here that [[Sylus]] observes a similar transformation of one of the twins in [[WU-10 Mischief#04 Thrill Seeker]], but Sylus is actually able to halt the transformation with his Evol. The crystals simply shatter under a strong force. This could speak to Sylus's power level, a particularity of the Energy Manipulation Evol, a nuance in the type of transformation occurring, or a continuity error.
