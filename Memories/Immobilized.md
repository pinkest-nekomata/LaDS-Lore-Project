**Description**
> While attending a gathering hosted by Hunters from Linkon and the Arctic in the remote Arctic region, l unexpectedly ran into Sylus. Moreover, our Evol Linkages somehow tangled together again...

# Summary
MC is in the [[Arctic]] for a symposium with the [[Arctic Hunter]] brach. [[Sylus]] is there, and something has caused [[Sylus and MC's Evol linkage]] to appear again. They try to recreate the circumstances of it disappearing previously (MC being asleep) and only make matters worse--when MC tries to push Sylus away, the tether tightens. Since she forgot her phone in her room, she has to sneak back there with Sylus. When her colleague Lois comes back for her coat, MC pushes Sylus into the closet. It's a close call, but Sylus ends up distracting Lois by calling MC's phone. Once Lois is gone, they're able to leave the closet, and the tether has disappeared.

# Key Info
* [[Sylus and MC's Evol linkage]] is influenced by MC's emotions. The length of the linkage gets longer each time because MC is becoming more fond of Sylus--and vice versa. It's not her wanting to push him away that triggers it to get shorter, but the flicker of sadness she has at the idea of pushing him away.
	* This is the first time black mist has manifested as part of it.

# Trivia
* The unnamed city in the [[Arctic]] is 3688 km from [[Linkon]].

# Quotes

> MC: Hmph... Second question. We're having a symposium with the Arctic Hunters in this hotel. What about you? Are you here to turn yourself in?
> Sylus: You didn't book the entire hotel. I have the money, and they had a vacant room. Why can't I stay here?

> Bethany: Sylus, I can't sleep.
> Sylus: Is that so? But I can.

> MC: This is the first time I've seen the black one. The linkage clings to mine. It is definitely related to our Aether Cores. They're like two snakes wanting to devour each other.
> Sylus: What a clever metaphor.

> MC: Other people's stuff is here. Close your eyes. And don't look.
> *I pin Sylus against the door as he impatiently removes his hat. He softly chuckles upon hearing my words before actually closing his eyes.*
> Sylus: Does this mean I can snoop around if it's all your stuff?

> Sylus: `(Leaning down.)` And? You'll just have to accept everything coming your way. When two snakes are devouring each other, one will inevitably be crowned the victor.
# Transcript

> Auctioneer: Okay, now we're at 8.5 million. Do I hear 9 million?
> Auctioneer: All right, 9 million from Mr. Zhang.
> *Dressed in loungewear, Sylus leans on the couch while he holds a phone in his left hand. The Evol Linkage on his wrist is slightly visible.*
> *And half an arm's length away from him, at the other end of the Evol Linkage, is me. I silently stare at the unshakable band on my right wrist.*
> MC:  (Wrong place, wrong time, wrong people-everything's not going my way. I shouldn't have gone on this trip...)
> *I lift my hand that's tethered to Sylus's and wave it in front of him.*
> MC: You spent the whole afternoon bidding and already got three revolvers and six gunstocks. How can you just sit there so relaxed with this thing on us?
> Sylus: It's not like I can remove it lying down.
> *All of a sudden, there's a thunderstorm. It's pouring. My last bit of patience dissipates, and I hit the sofa with my right hand.*
> MC: It's time for an interrogation! Sylus, you better give me some answers!
> Auctioneer: Mr Sylus of 6145 has correctly called the capped price! Sold!
> *The phone is tossed onto the floor. With a calm expression, Sylus finally glances at me.*
> Sylus: Ask.
> MC: First question. I traveled to the [[Arctic]], 3688 kilometers away from the [[N109 Zone]]. And I bumped into you. Why?
> *Sylus shrugs.*
> Sylus: I'm also curious. I don't often get to take vacations, and yet here I saw a familiar face.
> MC: Hmph... Second question. We're having a symposium with the Arctic Hunters in this hotel. What about you? Are you here to turn yourself in?
> Sylus: You didn't book the entire hotel. I have the money, and they had a vacant room. Why can't I stay here?
> MC: That wasn't a good enough answer... Onto the third question—
> *I lift my right hand and look at the barely visible Evol Linkage between us.*
> MC: Why does the tether's duration increase every time?
> *I can't help but feel nervous.*
> MC: What if it doesn't go away when the event starts later tonight...
> Sylus: We can go together. Probably.
> MC: Oh yeah, I should totally introduce my hunter friends to the renowned leader of Onychinus.
> Sylus: All you can do is pray for divine intervention. Remember, piety is key.
> MC: How can science be connected to superstition?
> *I lower my gaze, once again staring at the Evol Linkage that's impossible to cut.*
> MC: It didn't just bind us together for no reason. There must be a way to...
> Sylus: How? You were sleeping the last two times it untethered itself. You even pinned down my arm. It was very inconvenient.
> MC: Oh? You just gave me a new idea. If we recreate the circumstances of when it disconnected itself, we should be able to figure out the trigger, right?
> Sylus: `(Hmmm?)`...? That sounds more like superstition than science. Do you expect me to lull you to sleep?
> MC: Do you have a better idea?
> Sylus: ...It's 2:30 P.M., sweetie. Time for bed.
> *The heavy curtains, closed, blanket the room in darkness. Only a small night light in the corner emits a faint glow.*
> *The not-exactly-large sofa can't accommodate two people, so I can only awkwardly rest in Sylus's embrace.*
> Sylus: Rock a bye baby on the tree top... When the wind blows the cradle will rock...
> MC: ...
> Sylus: When the bough breaks... The cradle will fall...
> MC: Sylus, has anyone ever commented on your singing before?
> Sylus: At the very least Luke and Kieran gave a round of applause.
> MC: ...Explains why they're your right-hand men.
> *Speechless, I change into a more comfortable position, resting my cramped legs on the armrest.*
> MC: This is awful. Do you have other ways to lull people to sleep?
> Sylus: As if. I give you an inch and you take...
> MC: Sylus? (He's already asleep? Now that's what we call being worry-free...)
> *Pouting, I rest my head on Sylus's chest, poking him out of spite.*
> MC: Every time we run into each other, something bad happens. You must be the harbinger of trouble.
> Sylus: Hmm?
> *A threatening grunt reaches my ears. I lift my head and manage to smile sheepishly.*
> MC: Haha... You were still awake, huh...
> Sylus: Hmph. `(Scoff/tsk)`
> *After glancing at me as a warning, Sylus closes his eyes again.*
> *However, people often fail a lot when they want to do something.*
> *Sylus may have become quiet, but the steady heartbeat next to my ear becomes clearer. It keeps me awake.*
> Bethany: Sylus, I can't sleep.
> Sylus: Is that so? But I can.
> *Seeing how he's unconcerned, I feel even more annoyed. 1 slowly move my index and middle fingers toward him.*
> MC: (I wonder if you can still sleep when I pinch your nose.)
> *Just as I'm halfway there, Sylus silently opens his eyes and catches me red-handed.*
> Sylus: ?
> *I pause, then slowly stretch my index and middle fingers to make a V sign.*
> MC: ...Hey there. How many fingers am I holding up?
> Sylus: Close your eyes and stop talking. Today's patience is wearing thin.
> *A large hand presses my head against his shoulder. I'm forced into silence for two seconds, but then squirm uncomfortably.*
> *This greatly annoys my human pillow. Sylus suddenly stands up while holding me in his arms—*
> MC: Put me down! I was just changing my position. Go back to sleep!
> *Before I can continue, l'm thrown onto the bed. Sylus leans over me, pressing my wrist into the soft mattress.*
> Sylus: With you around, l've already gotten plenty of rest.
> *Sylus's shadow envelops me. Maybe it's because he's bothered by the sunlight that his narrowed eyes are particularly scary.*
> MC: Calm down. And stop looking at me like that. You're not thinking about using the [[Aether Core]] in your eye, are you?
> *While my arm is pinned, I quickly use my other arm, the one bound via the linkage, and push back his shoulder.*
> Sylus: Why isn't it tethered to both your hands?
> MC: I'm not the same person I was when we first met. You won't sway me that easily.
> *Despite speaking courageously, the memory of my first encounter with Sylus still surges forth.*
> *The feeling of being stared down by crimson eyes as if my soul was being forcibly taken over-panic and suffocation instantly spread throughout my body.*
> MC: Let go!
> *The thought of pushing him away is a small stone thrown into my heart. A certain pang spreads in my chest, causing my body to freeze.*
> *At the same time, Sylus is suddenly pulled by some force. He unexpectedly falls toward me.*
> MC: !
> Sylus: ...?! `(Surprised grunt/gasp)`
> MC: When I open my eyes, I'm pushing his face away with one hand. A cold gaze seemingly seeps between my fingers.
> Sylus: What did you do?
> MC: ...You threw yourself at me. I didn't do anything.
> *After suppressing the obvious irritation on his face, Sylus raises our hands that are entangled in the Evol Linkage.*
> Sylus: How do you explain this then?
> *For reasons unknown, the two rings on our wrists, instead of separating, are now stuck together.*
> MC: (Huh?!)
> *I'm shocked and don't know what to say. I can only stare at the corner of the ceiling.*
> MC: You need to move first.
> In silence, Sylus and I sit shoulder to shoulder.
> The evol linkages on our wrists are intertwined. They're inseparable.
> MC: This is the first time I've seen the black one. The linkage clings to mine. It is definitely related to our Aether Cores. They're like two snakes wanting to devour each other.
> Sylus: What a clever metaphor.
* ((Note the similarities to the key theme of [[Beyond Cloudfall]] and their relationship more broadly, see also [[interstellar arena]].))

> Sylus: You know, sweetie, the more a snake's prey tries to escape, the more tightly it gets strangled. Maybe the Evol Linkage got shorter because you were thinking of getting rid of me just now.
> *As much as I don't want to admit it, he's right.*
> *Being unable to resonate or escape, I sink into the bed and a pit of despair.*
> *Then, patting my pocket, I realize I left my phone in my hotel room.*
> MC: What time is it?
> *Sylus glances at the light coming out from behind the curtains.*
> Sylus: 6:30, give or take.
> *6:30 P.M. That's when the event starts.*
> *I sit up on the bed.*
> MC: This is bad. I need to tell my colleagues I won't be there.
> *There are hats and sunglasses in Sylus's room. I dress him up from head to toe and sneak back into my hotel room.*

> *Luckily, everyone went to the event. I didn't run into any acquaintances on the way.*
> MC: Lois. Lois, are you there?
> *Opening the door, I check again to ensure nobody's inside. Then I quickly pull Sylus into the room.*
> MC: Other people's stuff is here. Close your eyes. And don't look.
> *I pin Sylus against the door as he impatiently removes his hat. He softly chuckles upon hearing my words before actually closing his eyes.*
> Sylus: Does this mean I can snoop around if it's all your stuff?
> Walking past the luggage is a struggle when I can only use one hand to rummage through various things. Meanwhile, my other hand drags along a man who's almost two meters tall and can't see.
> MC: I know your eyes are closed, but get ready to make a break for it. We grab the stuff and run.
> Sylus: Taking your own stuff doesn't count as stealing, by the way.
> MC: This is our hunter's place. I feel nervous having you linger here for too long.
> *I look and look, but I can't find my phone. And to make matter worse, Sylus is being noisy next to me.*
> Sylus: Someone's about to walk in.
> MC: Stop trying to scare me.
> *Just as I'm about to go to the nightstand, I hear the sound of a card being swiped to open the door. It's followed by laughter.*
> Lois: Give me a moment. I'll grab my coat first and then we can go.
> *Surprised, I look at Sylus. Sylus calmly returns my gaze. His expression spells out four words: "I told you so."*
> MC: You... Ugh, move!
> *With very little time to think, I quickly push him into a nearby closet.*
> `The kindled scene begins with Sylus and MC sitting on the floor, the Evol Linkage visible on Sylus's left wrist and MC's right wrist. Black mist is visible for the first time, not just red and gold. The closet is made of wood, mostly empty except for some items at the bottom, and it has ventilation slats. There's a bar light at the top.`
> Sylus: Why are you rushing... `(Takes off sunglasses)` Or are you using this opportunity to avenge yourself? `(Stern, frowning.)`
> `MC goes to stand up and looks down at the linkage.`
> MC: ...Sylus, stand up.
> Sylus: Are you ordering me around? `(Skeptical, humorless)`
> `MC lifts their wrists, as if to say he has to stand so she can. He sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, then they stand together.`
> MC: `(Looks at the linkage again, her wrist held aloft by Sylus casually leaning against the hanging bar in the closet.)` You?!
> Sylus: Stay right there. Shhh. `(Raises a finger towards his lips)` She's coming.
> `MC goes to hide. She pushes against Sylus's chest.`
> MC: Move!
> Sylus: `(Smug, slight smile)` I did nothing wrong. And if we meet, we can say hello to each other.
> MC: And I won't be able to clear my name even if I have a redemption arc.
> Sylus: So you think we're safe now?
> Lois: Did I put it in the closet?
> `MC puts her hand over Sylus's mouth, and he grunts quietly, brow furrowed as he glares at her. Footsteps are heard, and Sylus glances out of the closet through the slats.`
> Lois: Or in my suitcase...
> `Footsteps retreat. MC drops her hand and looks at the slats.`
> Sylus: Anxious? Then close your eyes. 
> `He pulls her against his chest. Louis comes to the cloest door, and Sylus puts a hand out against the sliding door to keep it from opening.`
> Lois: Huh? Why can't I open the closet...
> Sylus: Pretend you're a coat that doesn't breathe or have a heartbeat. It should be easy.
> `MC looks down and realizes her hand is still against Sylus's abdomen, then she goes to pinch him.`
> MC: We'll be discovered with how much noise we're making!
> Sylus: Heh. `(Leaning closer, expression becoming more serious, whispering)` Don't move then.
> Lois: Hold on. Let me try again...
> Sylus: `(Whispering, amused)` If we're discovered, it might be better just to confess.
> `MC puts a hand against his shoulder and pushes him back.`
> MC: Are you crazy? Confess what?
> Sylus: ... `(Half laugh)` Your mental fortitude's terrible.
> `He pulls her closer again. Her left hand remains against his shoulder/chest.`
> MC: !
> Louis: How did her phone end up... Oh? So my coat *was* here. `(Voice getting further away)` I got it. Let's head on over. I'll find someone to fix the closet later.
> `Sylus lifts his phone in his left hand between them.`
> MC: Did you call...
> `Sylus turns the phone around, showing a contact photo of MC labeled "Kitten" and a pending call.`
> Sylus: Don't worry, it was an unknown number. I'm not in the mood to reveal our relationship right now.
> *Only when I hear the door being closed do I cautiously step out of the closet.*
> MC: No one's here.... Hurry up!
> *After checking the room, I turn back to look at Sylus who just walked out of the closet. Then I realize the Evol Linkage quietly untethered us.*
> Sylus: Haha, being too close to you is just asking for trouble.
> MC: ...Says the person who caused all this.
* Translation note:
	* CN: ⋯•…•惡人先告狀。
	* MTL: The wicked will sue first / the bad guy complains first.
		* Note that she's specifically calling him a villain/bad guy (惡人, "the wicked"), and he echoes this in his reply.

> *Sylus dusts off his shoulder and fixes his hair.*
> Sylus: Yes, yes. So get used to it already. 
> Sylus: Being tied to a bad man like me is beyond reasonable.
* Translation note:
	* CN: 所以趕快習慣吧，和我這個惡人綁在一起，是沒有道理可
	* MTL: It's unreasonable to be tied up with me, a villain / It makes no sense to be tied to a bad guy like me.
		* He uses 個惡人 to refer to himself, i.e. "a wicked man"/"a bad guy"
	* To native EN speakers, "beyond reasonable" usually means "extremely reasonable", but the correct translation is "unreasonable" or "makes no sense".

> MC: It's a shame... We still don't know how the Evol Linkage untethered itself.
> *Touching my wrist, I feel a strange emptiness. Meanwhile, out of the corner of my eye, Sylus has returned to looking at me.*
> MC: Do you have something else to say?
> Sylus: You didn't want the linkage to be broken? `(Realization)`
> *From our mouths, two different sentences are uttered at the same time. It takes me a while to understand what he just said.*
> MC: Says who?!
> Sylus: Me. This thing takes longer to disconnect every time. I guess you like me a lot more now.
> MC: ...Okay, narcissist.
> Sylus: Sweetie, when people don't want to accept the truth, they're quick to deny things.
* Translation note:
	* CN: 人在心虛時，會否定得很快。
	* MTL: When people feel guilty, they're quick to deny it.
		* Minor note, since the CN gets a little more at the "thou dost protest too much" accusation / common sense, but the localization makes more sense in context.

> *Slightly raising my gaze, I can see the grin on the corner of Sylus's lips. Even without insisting anymore, he gives off an air of finesse.*
> MC: (When did he start to be not as obnoxious...) 
> *I clear my throat, ready to give a retort.*
> MC: Or maybe it's the other way around. You're the one who's starting to like me more.
> Sylus: You're not wrong.
> *Nonchalantly saying those words, Sylus puts on his sunglasses and heads to the door by himself.*
> MC: Wait, you're leaving just like that?
> Sylus: I see, you're worried that I'll get caught by the surveillance camera when I go out. It's not because you want me to stay, right?
> *I purse my lips and walk up to him. I put the hat on his head.*
> MC: Yeah, so you better leave quietly. Don't let anyone see you, or else you'll ruin our symposium.
> *He clearly understands the concern beneath my words, but he chooses not to address it.*
> Sylus: \<Name>, does this mean that one day, even without the linkage, you'll choose to stand by my side?
> MC: ...When the time comes, we'll be dealing with things other than a simple linkage.
* Translation note:
	* CN: 真的到那個時候，要解決的就不是簡單的鏈路問題了
	* MTL: When that time comes, the problem to be solved will not be a simple link problem.
	* I was hoping to get a little more clarity here, but the MTL doesn't really offer any insights. Based on Sylus's reaction, I think the interpretation that this is sort of an, "As if, it'll take much bigger problems than an Evol linkage to get me to stand at your side" is the intended one.

> *Sylus lowers his gaze, his emotions fluctuating.*
> *Some time passes before the corners of his mouth curl up, as if the Evol Linkage is still present. With his left hand, he intertwines his fingers with my right hand.*
> Sylus: `(Leaning down.)` And? You'll just have to accept everything coming your way. When two snakes are devouring each other, one will inevitably be crowned the victor.
* Translation note:
	* CN: 就算是呢？你也只能接受了。那兩條互相吞食的小蛇，也總會有決出勝負的一天。
	* MTL: \[Even if it is? / So What?] You can only accept it. Those two little snakes devouring each other will eventually decide the winner.
	* For some reason, "You can only accept it" lands a little better for me here, but the essence is the same.
