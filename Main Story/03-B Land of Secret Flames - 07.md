# Summary
The next day, they arrive at [[Jewel Reef]]. [[MC]] detects [[fluctuation]]s from the jewelry's safe, confirming it's suspicious, but they won't be able to get closer until the party. With time to kill, [[Rafayel]] asks the arranged driver to take them to the best view on the island.

They hike along the shore, and [[Rafayel]] reveals that the island used to be underwater. He reminisces about [[Lemuria]] without naming it, but MC guesses correctly that he's thinking about it. They arrive at the [[blue hole]], where [[MC]] is captivated by its depths. [[Rafayel]] warns her not to be lured in, then mentions legends about such holes--that they contain portals to other worlds or great treasure.

MC is left with a distinct sense of tremor in her heart, but isn't sure whether the source is Rafayel or the sea.
# Details
The next day at noon, they arrive at [[Jewel Reef]].
> Butler: What's most notable about this island is the extraordinary [[blue hole]] situated at its center. It's a rare marvel of the world...

The butler adds that the banquet will be at 7pm, and offers transportation. [[Rafayel]] complains about having a headache due to being up late, then suddenly [[MC]] feels [[fluctuation]]s coming from a well-guarded safe that's being taken off the yacht. She's now certain the jewelry is suspicious.

[[Rafayel]] assures MC that [[Gabriella]] will wear the jewelry at the banquet, allowing MC plenty of chances to get closer. They step into the car that's been arranged for them, and [[Rafayel]] tells her to have some fun, asking to be taken to the best view on the island.

They end up by the [[blue hole]] (but not at it yet), in picturesque ocean scenery. MC correctly guesses that something on the island is connected to [[Lemuria]].
> MC: They say time works its magic on everything. Who knows, maybe this tiny island was once a small garden in [[Lemuria]] thousands or millions of years ago.

Rafayel says he doesn't know if it was a garden, but he confirms that the island used to be below the ocean, showing traces of a coral reef on the ground.

> Rafayel: Once upon a time, in an era beyond anyone's wildest imagination, this place wasn't covered with grass. Coral reefs stretched as far as the eye can see. Shells and countless sea creatures, like fish, shrimps, and crabs, used to call it home. Distant and intriguing--the land was a realm of unfathomable mystery to them. But in the end, their once familiar homeland turned into the strangest of worlds.
> *His tone is light, tinged with an elusive emotion. HIs words are carried away by the sea breeze as soon as they leave his lips.*
* ((This evokes the [[Lemurian disaster]]))

There's a dialogue option to ask if Rafayel's thinking about his homeland, or that you just wanted to look at him. Rafayel's cagey if asked about his homeland.

They continue walking and come to a rocky tidal flat with a small boat beached on the shore. Rafayel identifies it as an antique from a few centuries back, but usable.
* ((Is this a hint that he used such boats earlier in his immortal lifespan?))

It reminds [[MC]] of the rowboat they used to get to [[Hat Island]] (in [[01-07 Moonlight Under Sea]]) and she teases him about whether they're about to have another adventure. Just as she's complaining they haven't seen the [[blue hole]] yet, Rafayel says they've arrived.

He notes [[Maxwell]]'s mansion-like buildings on another part of the edge, but says this is the best place to view it. Rafayel adds that it's not just beautiful--due to low oxygen levels, barely anything can live inside of it, and this has lead to legends.
> Rafayel: Some say the [[blue hole]] is a gateway to another world. Others believe it hides countless treasures.

MC says people have wild imaginations, but Rafayel says there's no evidence to disprove the legends, and an "unimaginable secret" might be within it, after all. Rafayel looks poised to take flight and leap into the Blue. 

> An inexplicable tremor reverberates form the depths of my heart. Yet I'm not sure if Rafayel's words or a distant call from under the sea caused it.
