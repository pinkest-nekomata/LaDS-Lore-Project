# Summary
[[MC]] still needs a closer look at the jewelry, so she plans to get it from the vault. She talks briefly with [[Rafayel]] and he reveals that he's disguised to hide from his enemies that are also on the ship. Though he refuses to say more for now, MC invites him on her jewelry heist.

With the help of an earring device from the [[Hunters Association]] and their intel, MC has memorized the yacht's layout and knows all the guards' routes. She and Rafayel begin their plan, with only a 10 minute window before the passcode to the vault where the jewelry is kept changes. But on the way, they hear [[Maxwell]] approaching to someone who's affiliated with an important company ((soon revealed to be [[Ever]])).

# Details
[[MC]] couldn't get very close to the jewelry that night, and didn't sense any [[fluctuation]]s from where she stood. After the event, her conversation with [[Rafayel]] reveals they haven't yet told each other their purposes for being there.

MC probes a bit, asking if [[Rafayel]] is in disguise due to the people who took out a bounty on him ([[01-07.01 Investigation]]). He says yes, but that he has other enemies on this ship. MC gives him a hard time for dragging her into danger. They flirt a little, then MC invites [[Rafayel]] on her planned midnight heist. Rafayel says the sea at night is the perfect stage for a performance.

At 9:15 PM, while the guards change, they head out to try to get closer to the jewelry. MC has already memorized the yacht's layout. And she's wearing an earring from the [[Hunters Association]] that also has the guards' schedules, patrol routes, and the vault passcode. But the passcode changes every ten minutes, so they have only a narrow window.

As they approach the vault, planning to distract the guards with Rafayel's fire. But then they overhear a conversation:
> ?? (man): You're a good man, [[Maxwell]]. Spending a fortune just to make your wife smile...
> Maxwell: My small gift pales in comparison to your company's wealth and power.
> MC: (Why is Maxwell here?!)

Rafayel pulls her down a hatch in the floor to hide.
