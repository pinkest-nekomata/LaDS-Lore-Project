A key incident in [[04 Homecoming Wings]].

Occurred in the [[Cascade District]] of [[Skyhaven]], first mentioned in [[04-01.01 Infiltration]]. As soon as the explosion occurred, the mysterious and usually passive [[Farspace Fleet]] jumped in and put the area under lockdown, citing [[Wanderer]] threats. They also evacuated all residents within a two-kilometer radius (about 4/5ths of a mile). ([[04-01.06 Veiled Sanctuary]])

The mysterious new [[Colonel]] (later revealed to be [[Caleb]]) denied requests from the [[Skyhaven Branch]] of the [[Hunters Association]] to investigate the supposed [[Metaflux]] explosion, claiming there was sensitive Fleet matters that needed to be handled internally. The Fleet earns media criticism for not disclosing more information about the investigation. ([[04-01.01 Infiltration]])

Per the latest version of the [[Main Story Timeline Flowchart.canvas|Main Story Timeline Flowchart]], this most likely takes place in Autumn 2049, almost a year after the [[Bloomshore District explosion]].
