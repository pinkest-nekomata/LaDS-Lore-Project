**Description**
> Before leaving Linkon City for the upcoming mission, Sylus and I are cherishing these moments of peaceful, ordinary life together...

# Summary
Sylus and MC discuss ordinary moments while seeing a blockbuster movie at the mall, agreeing to go on a spring outing together after MC returns from her mission. At the mission location, MC goes undercover to join a deadly hunting game at an old castle (later revealed to be [[Sylus's castle]]) that pits [[Wanderer]]s against human contestants. After saving a fellow contestant from a [[Wanderer]], [[MC]] flees guards and finds [[Sylus]] in a VIP viewing room.

He helps her get to the game's organizer, allowing the [[Hunters Association]] to deal with the criminals. With the threat cleared, [[MC]] stays and the next day Sylus takes her on an outing to show why he purchased the castle. Nearby is a [[mist-veiled dimension]] containing a massive dragon's skeleton. The kindled scene depicts them climbing around the flower-draped skeleton. As they leave, Sylus assures her that this world wasn't a dream, and he offers to take her to all such worlds he's found.
