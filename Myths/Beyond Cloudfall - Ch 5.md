# Summary
MC and Sylus become true companions and settle into a rhythm of pillaging. Through a star map and starships, [[Philos]]'s other Plates are within reach, too.

As they get to know each other better, MC uncovers Sylus's secret--he's only a young dragon. He also doesn't feed much--if ever--on human souls. Most of them are less palatable than the Wanderer Protocores. MC's soul being bland is actually a compliment.

This time, when he asks her what she wants, she has a new kind of answer--she wants his love. ((The player can also select "Your Soul" #todo try to find this on YT)) But a fiend's love doesn't exist--making it more precious.

Sylus decides she needs to see what happens to a dragon's lover. He takes her to Tarus for a play, but she falls asleep during it. As he carries her home, she asks him to tell her the story. So, he tells his story--their story. At the end, he reveals that a dragon's fate is always to kill their beloved.

## Commentary

# Details
> During my day sin the dragon's lair, Sylus and I achieve a delicate balance.
> I couldn't obtain his eye, and he never brought up the fiendish deal that would cost me my soul.
> We live like true companions, together in the dragon's lair above [[Tarus]] City. When dusk descends, we venture out for reckless raids and return with our spoils before dawn.
> My favorite sight was watching the Judicator's army, who had been ruthlessly extorting people with warnings of impending doom, fall to their knees a the sight of a real fiend and a resurrected sorceress.
> The thrill of revenge made my soul tremble. And each time, he would ask me, "Is there anything else you desire?"
> The dragon personally nurtures my ambition as he leads me from one raid to another. Regardless of how dangerous the target is, as long as I say, "I want it," he fulfills my every wish without fail.
> Fate tumbles like an uncontrollable bead rolling into a bottomless abyss.
> Under the guise of helping me get my revenge, he feeds the beast in my heart called "Desire." I know he is.
> Yet slowly... my heart gains new desires.

MC and Sylus sit around the horde, discussing their next target. There's many places they've already been. They examine a star map together.

> Dragon: Didn't you say you wanted the minerals and starships here?
> *His tone barely conceals his excitement. On my shoulder, the mark he left faintly burns with the blood-red gleam in his eyes. I touch the burning skin and recall the Sanctuary we raided two days ago. A Judicator's Oracle, wearing a splendid white robe, is held up by one hand. A rabid, bestial cruelty boils in the dragon's eyes.*
> MC: (Back then, the mark hurt just like this...)
> *I shake my head and decide not to think about whether the pain was an omen of things to come. I rest my chin on my hand as he says a long, drawn- out "ohhh".*
> MC: You remember everything I said.
> *Sylus raises an eyebrow and takes a blood orange from the silver platter. I quickly snatch it away. When he's caught off-guard, I arch my back like a cat and pounce. I press a silver knife against his neck.*
> MC: Be honest with me. What do you gain from indulging my desires like this?
> *I pin him down against a cushion. The knife and bleeding wound dissipate into crimson light particles as he chuckles. Sylus looks up at me. We can feel each other's breaths. As he raises his head, his nose gently brushes against mine.*
> Sylus: What about you? What's in it for you to attempt an assassination with such a weak hand?
> *Before the curtains, our eyes meet. The afterglow is reflected in his eyes which emit a surreal warmth. A strange flutter brushes against my heart, and a soft laugh escapes my lips. I return to my original spot before peeling and savoring a pomegranate.*
> MC: You don't need to tell me. The greedier the soul, the more delicious it is. Am I mistaken? In any case, let's hope it doesn't backfire on you.
> *Sylus laughs. As I take out another pomegranate seed, he leans in and snatches it with his teeth.*
> Sylus: Likewise. You haven't fled because you're waiting for an opportunity to take my eye. Is that right?
> *But as I stare into his eyes, I fond that I don't truly want to hurt him. Besides the horns and tail, he's almost no different from a human.*

> Aside from searching for places to plunder, the dragon and I often meet at the top of the lair.
> Sometimes, I tell him stories I've heard. He rarely speaks, as if he's engrossed. Or perhaps he just wants someone to watch the moon with him.
> Occasionally, the dragon talks about himself. He speaks about the myriad of dragon-slaying weapons in his treasure trove and the 108 ways humans have tried to kill him.
* ((Note, 108 is a highly symbolic number in religion and martial arts. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/108_(number)#Religion_and_the_arts)) This comment also hints at the origin of the name of the [[N109 Zone]].))
> But most of the time, we just sit together and say nothing.
> The gentle night smooths his sharp scales and reveals his true form.

> *The sun is setting, and the rocks still retain daylight's warmth. Drowsy, I'm in the middle of relaxing and drying my hair that I just washed.*
> Sylus: Does your song truly need an organ? We already bought a bone flute. 
> *I don't know when the dragon decided to lie down next to me. I pat his damp hair.*
> MC: Why don't I teach you the song since you liked it so much?
> Sylus: No.
> MC: You don't want to? Or you don't think you can learn it?
> *I cup his face in my hands and make him meet my gaze.*
> MC: I just realized something these days. You don't understand a song's melody, can't see the beauty in patterns, and can't even taste the flavors of food. Is that right?
> Sylus: `(Scoffs)` Dragons don't need those things to survive.
> *He escapes from my hands, yet I detect a hint of awkwardness in his words.*
> MC: You act mature, but you were sealed away for so long... Sylus, you're still a young dragon, aren't you?
> Sylus: ? `(Scoffs)`
> MC: You only just learned how to hide your wings...
> *I gently stroke the horns on top of his head. Then, my hand glides down his prominent spine and reaches his tail.*
> MC: But you can't hide your horns and tail. Are you an adult? Don't tell me you're just acting mature because you're worried about ruining your "fiendish" image.
> *The dragon stays silent and flicks his tail away from me. He loops it around us, and it touches the small of my back.*
> Sylus: Are you trying to say you've uncovered my secret?
> *A defiant source gently pulls me toward the dragon's chest.*
> Sylus: Alright, let's assume there is a young dragon before you. What will you do? Eat it?
> MC: ... I'd tell it that we're doing something humans call "hugging".
> Sylus: Then do humans still hug each other even when they want to kill each other? Like us?
> *Clouds drift across the sky and cover the moonlight for a moment. It's difficult for me to discern his facial expression. Some words are like the moonlight hidden by the clouds. Once the moment passes, there's no need to say them anymore. I roll into a more relaxed position and lie on my back.*
> MC: What does a human soul taste like? We've known each other for so long, but I've never seen you eat... Have you never eaten a soul? 
> *The dragon remains on his side. He stares at me as if my face holds secrets he hasn't discovered yet.*
> Sylus: Most human souls are disgusting. They're even less appealing than a [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protocore]].
> MC: When I first saw you, you said my soul was "lackluster". Was that actually a compliment?
> Sylus: `(Laughs)` Indeed, it's as lifeless as a slice of turkey meat.
> MC: ...
> *Thinking back, I can't help but laugh.*
> Sylus: Is there something else you want? 
> MC: No...
> *Maybe I just wanted to know if a dragon, capable of luring humans into darkness... Could truly feel the human emotion called "love", a desire that goes beyond mere survival. In his world, apart from survival and killing, could there also be room for pipe organs and hugs? Or maybe this person next to me only appears to be human. And his indulgence toward me is just so he can obtain my soul.*
> MC: Sylus, those gems and weapons are boring. If you want to cultivate my desire, you need to give me something rare. 
* ((See also [[cultivation]]))
> MC: This time, I want...
> *I can't stand being the only one who's troubled by this thought. So, I demand something from him he can never own and will never offer.*
> MC: Your love.
* ((Player can also chose "Your soul".))
> *As expected, he looks surprised and then laughs.*
> Sylus: A fiend's love? What are you going to do with something that doesn't exist? 
> MC: If it doesn't exist, then it's even more precious.
> Sylus: `(sighs/scoffs)` Speak. What does it mean to truly love a person? Have you ever loved anyone before?
> MC: ...No, but I know exactly what to do.
> *I move closer to him and lift myself up to plant a kiss on the dragon's forehead.*
> Sylus: ...
> MC: When humans fall in love, they want to kiss it. Maybe... dragons feel the same way.
> *The dragon's claws sweep across my cheek. Once again, he looks at me as if I'm prey.*
> Sylus: But maybe you should know the fate that befalls a dragon's lover.

> *Tarus City's tavern is always open. Onstage, a woman wearing a fiery red dress has just left. Amidst the boisterous cacophany form the drunkards, I sit next to Sylus who's in the shadows by the window. I wear a hooded cloak.*
> MC: How are the souls here? Does their scent make you feel nauseous?
> Sylus: It's chaotic, but it's still better than the hypocritical Sanctuary.
> *Thud. A waiter has placed a wooden cup filled with red liquid in front of me before walking away. Under the lights, a dragon's roar suddenly resounds as an actor with dragon wings on his back sings center stage. Sylus didn't bring me here for a midnight snack.*
> MC: You're already a dragon. Why do I need to watch a fake one?
> Sylus: Don't you humans like stories? Watch it.
> *It seems to be a very long story. The actor who's playing the dragon sings for a long time without changing. Bored, I stir the beef sauce on my plate. Words fly over my head since I'm barely paying attention.
> The body next to me is warm. I wrap the dragon's tail around myself and move closer. Resting my head on his shoulder, I drift in and out of sleep.*
> MC: Other cities should be chaotic because of the [[Legion of Justitia]]. But the people in [[Tarus]] City still have happy lives.
* ((MTL: "There's probably war raging outside". Connotation is that it's a guess/inference, not a declaration.))
> Sylus: The people here are like seeds. They only grow if they're fortunate. Even if they sprout, they might not survive the next day. They can only live in the moment.
> MC: Are we also people who "might not survive the next day"?
> Sylus: What are you trying to say?
> *I grab the dragon's wrist. Smiling, I narrow my eyes.*
> MC: I want to say something that's more precious than any treasure a human could obtain. ... I like you.
* ((May be better localized as: "I really like you"/"I'm fond of you.". The CN is ...喜欢你 ("like you"), which comes from the full phrase 我喜欢你, which means "I like you". From [LingoPie](https://lingopie.com/blog/i-love-you-in-chinese/): "This is a common phrase used when you're getting to know someone or in the early stages of a relationship. It’s less intense than saying "I love you," but it still communicates interest and affection."))
> Sylus: ?
> MC: I like who you are right at this moment.
> *I turn away and notice how the dragon's face is faintly reflected on the window. I secretly watch him and notice his smile that vanishes as quickly as it appears.*
> Sylus: Turn around.
> *He grips my shoulder and forces me to face him.*
> Sylus: Are you trying to move me with your human love?
> MC: I said it because I wanted to. Now that moment has come and gone.
> *The dragon pulls my hood over my eyes. My heart slightly trembles, but all I receive is a gentle flick.*
> Sylus: Too late. I'll remember this.
> *I turn and the story onstage has reached its final act. the actor playing a fiend embraces and kisses his lover. At the same time, he plunges his blood-soaked claws into her chest.*

> *At night, the dragon carries the sleepy girl through Tarus City's crowded alleys. No one spares them another glance. It truly looks like he's an ordinary human returning home in the moonlight.*
> MC: Sylus... I don't understand the play you made me see. Maybe I fell asleep halfway through.
> Sylus: Then sleep. It wasn't an interesting play in either case.
> MC: But I want to hear it. You must tell me, or else I'm going to have nightmares.
> Sylus: `(Laughs)` It's about a dragon.
> *Figures surround them. He could fly her back to the dragon's lair. But tonight, he wants to walk a bit longer with her.*
> Sylus: In the beginning, the dragon lived in a valley with other dragons. Amongst his kin, he was the only one with a human appearance. He mistakenly believed he was a normal person. But as he grew older, horns sprouted from his head and a tail from his back. He had never seen anything like this on someone before. He was scared, so he picked up a blade because he wanted to remove them. But the horns and scales would grow back, dripping with blood. It didn't matter how many times he cut them.
> *He turns and walks onto a small path. There are fewer people here. His voice softens as if he's actually lulling her to sleep.*
> Sylus: After a long time, he finally came to terms with being a monster with horns. But then, the love of his life appeared.
> *The moment she pulled out her sword, he knew she was the one destined to kill him... She was his archnemesis. But somewhere along the way, he stopped wanting to consume her soul.*
> Sylus: She showed him human love and companionship, making him think he could live like a human too. And slowly, without realizing it, he began to forget he was a dragon.
> *Maybe it was the first time she climbed to the cave's opening, and the morning light touched her dirty, scraped face. Or maybe it was her unchecked, ever-growing desire that reminded him of his old self. Or perhaps, deep down, she's also a little monster with horns of her own.*
> Sylus: Yet a monster can never truly become a human. He cannot escape his fate as a dragon, nor can he love anyone for long. Dragons have an inherent tendency to toy with human desire. But in the end, they inevitably become enslaved by it and turn into true monsters... At the end of the story, he killed his beloved. This is the dragon's curse.
> *As he walks away, the lights fade behind him. He pulls off his cloak, revealing the creature beneath--his form with dragon horns and a tail remains.*
> MC: Sylus, do you hate humans?
> Sylus: I wouldn't say I like them for now.
> MC: ...But I'm a human too.
> Sylus: ... `(Shakes head.)`
> *Invisible wings slice through the air. Carrying the sleepy girl, he soars through the skies.
> ... What about you? Why stay by a dragon's side?*
