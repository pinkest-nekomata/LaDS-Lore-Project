The main POV character of [[WU-14 Elysium]].

aka Mr. P.

A talented and notorious "thief" working in the [[N109 Zone]] since before 2036. He doesn't really steal for monetary gain.

He is not a thief per-se so much as an "exchange artist":
> Everything has a price. Pain is traded for an equal amount of pain. Joy is exchanged for an equal amount of joy. But is your happiness truly equal to mine?
> -- [[Connoisseur's Menu#24k Exchange Artist]]

[[WU-14 Elysium#01 Meeting]] illustrates this exchange, where Pea "exchanges" the diamond watch he recently obtained for the "plushie bomb" from [[Kris's Antiques and Oddities]]. The implication is that the frog plushie with the bomb inside (and perhaps the experience of sticking it to Kris) is of equal joy to Pea as the diamond-studded watch.

He once got his hands on the notorious [[Protocore map]] that kicked off the [[2036 Disaster]], then exchanged it to help ensure the protection of [[Aislinn]] and [[Elysium]] during that disaster.
