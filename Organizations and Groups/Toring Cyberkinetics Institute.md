Its director, [[Professor Lucius]], sometimes also goes by Dr. L and is the leading authority in the field. 

The institute has an advanced robotic surgery system which is able to instal the bionic parts. These limbs are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing (at least visually) and the lab contains racks full of such parts and enhancements. There's also a cryogenic chamber and an all-white experiment room.
