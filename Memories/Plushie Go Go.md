**Description**
> [[Twinkle Toys]] has set up a branch in [[Bloomshore District]]. Tara agreed to hang out with me on its opening day, but she ditched me at the last second... Thankfully, I ran into someone else. It was a pleasant surprise.

# Summary
MC runs into [[Xavier]] at [[Twinkle Toys]], and he's on-guard. He has the address and reports of danger, and senses something explosive from one of the toys in a claw machine. To avoid collateral damage, he resolves to get it out with the crane instead of breaking the machine.

After three hours, they're almost out of tokens. MC gets the plushie on the first try--and it's got a harmless sparkler effect. They leave together, with Xavier asking her to teach him how to win at the crane machine in exchange for being her mission partner.

This occurs before MC and Xavier are regular mission partners.

# Key Info
* [[Xavier]] has slayed over 70,000 Wanderers, and started practicing swordsmanship when he was three
* [[Xavier]] asks [[MC]] to teach him how to win at the claw machine, and in exchange he offers to be her mission partner and hunt [[Wanderer]]s with her.
* MC notes that Xavier always disappears without a trace (she doesn't yet know he can teleport).

# Trivia
* [[Xavier]] remembers that this address (500 Treeshade Road) used to be a video rental store, over a decade ago.
* Meta trivia: The grumpy crow plush is visible in the crane game, though this bond was released ~6mo before [[Sylus]]'s release. Other plushies that were unreleased at the time are also visible, like the Frisky Cat and Pilot Frog, which came out in 2025.
* Xavier consulted the book [[Claw Machines: From Beginner to Master]] prior to this mission.
	* He laments that it only covered the basics.
* When Xavier says that his sword practice was boring until his master took in another apprentice, this is a reference to him and [[Queen MC]] in [[Shooting Stars]].
