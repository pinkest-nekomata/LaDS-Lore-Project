# Summary
((This one is quite long, so refer to the chapter summaries for Ch 1 - 7. Since Ch 8 and 9 are nonlinear, they're summarized below in chronological order. See below for justifications for this interpretation.))

At the black chapel, she soothes him until he's his usual self. To defy the fate that says she must kill him, she saves him instead. They trade half their souls, forging an unbreakable bond.

That night, the judicators arrive and the two are forced apart. The dragon cannot be killed, but MC is captured and brought back to the Sanctuary. Since they now each have half of the other's soul, this separation is traumatic.

Sylus's body remains hiding out in the [[black chapel]]. While there, MC's soul accompanies him in making the place their own. They find companionship and enjoy their days, and eventually, Sylus shows her a field of blooming [[datura]]s, and an unexpected side of himself. Since he's been her locomotion for all this time, she couldn't have discovered the valley herself. So, he's been waiting to show it to her.

Meanwhile, MC's body remains chained in the Sanctuary. Through the soul fragment, Sylus visits her each night, keeping her company. He dries the dew from her hair and they talk about dreams. This memory is their last lucid night together.

Over time, the rift in their souls is too much. MC starts to lose track of who she is--sometimes she's the dragon hiding out in the chapel, sometimes she's chained in the courtyard. The dragon is going mad, rampaging across the planet.

Finally, the Judicators decide it's time for her judgment, but she doesn't yet know this is a trap for the dragon. She endures a punishment in the form of a lightning storm, meant to evoke [[Heavenly Tribulation]], her punishment for going against fate. Sylus arrives and the soldiers jump into action, revealing the trap. He kills them all.

When MC is the last one, she's ready to accept her death. But instead, he effectively falls on her sword--he returns to his human form, pulling her hand over his chest and resonating with her. The sword appears, and uses his strength to pull it all the way into his chest. He tells her that she must press on--or else fate will drag them both to the Abyss forever.

With the last of his strength, he carries her back to the valley. As he lies there in his dragon form, she holds him as he dies. This is the memory that starts chapter 8 and concludes chapter 9. 

Now that they're together again, the memories from the two halves of each of their souls mingle. These are the "chaotic nightmares" that MC remembers at the start of chapter 8. Due to the bisecting of their souls and their separation, the two sets of memories intersect and overlap in her perception, creating confusion. For a moment, she can't remember why she's there at all.

Slowly, it comes back. As the dragon finally dies, his soul flows through her, showing her the truth of his childhood--the dragons were living peacefully when they were hunted down and exterminated. She realizes, "My beloved was born into apocalyptic terror."

His rejecting of fate, sacrificing his life so she could live, is as painful as a sword in her own chest. When the last of his soul is about to fade away, she curses him. Only she can grant him a true death.

In this last act of greediness, she embraces her true nature, sprouting horns and tail and becoming a dragon--but only after her beloved is gone.

## Commentary
### MC's own hunger
She, too, seems to have been born a dragon. This is thematically connected to having the courage and honest to follow one's heart and true desires. To live without hypocrisy. To know what you want and reach for it.
>I said I'll live, didn't I? No matter the cost. If following our hearts is a sin, then you and I must be the last of our kind in this world.
>-- [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 7]]

## Meaning of the endings
At the start of Chapter 8, the storytelling becomes particularly fragmented and non-linear, which itself evokes the experience that the characters are going through. Here's the breakdown:
* The scene that begins Chapter 8 is finished in Chapter 9--MC in the valley, holding Sylus in his dragon form as he dies. In Chapter 8, her fragmented memories and confusion are the result of the two halves of their two souls briefly coming together, allowing separate memories to intermingle. In Chapter 9 and in the final scene, clarity has returned, and she understands the full context of events.
	* She says, "Those visions... I can't tell if they really happened, if they're just my own fantasies, or if they're his. Or maybe I'm seeing... the other half of his soul that's within me."
	* This indicates that we're meant to understand the memories that come next with this in mind--that each body can interact with and even manifest the half of the other's soul that resides with them.
		* Since Sylus can even raise the dead and briefly stop time, his power would certainly be sufficient to physically manifest a soul fragment, allowing the two to continue to interact.
* After their night at the chapel, the soldiers attacked, and their two bodies were separated. MC is taken back to the Sanctuary, and Sylus stays at the black chapel.
	* We can understand this to be what "really" happened that night because it's the most plausible--there's no way the soldiers wouldn't find them there, especially with the Fiend weakened and the trail of blood.
	* Also, if we assume this to be what physically happened to their bodies, the rest falls into place--each memory "branch" occurs where one of their bodies is.
* While they're separated, each is able to experience the other through their half of the other's soul.
	* While Sylus hides out in the black chapel, he and that half of MC's soul are able to be happy together for a while. Based on what MC says in Ch 8 ("Only I know my dragon is still alive"), the Judicator at least temporarily believes that the Fiend is dead, buying them time. This is when he takes her to the valley.
	* While MC is chained in the Sanctuary, she and that half of Sylus's soul are able to keep each other company. He dries her hair. They talk about dreams.
		* She specifically notes "He flies across the Abyss to find me on every moonlit night. This is a secret that only I can see." Based on her comments about the mysterious visions at the start of Ch 8, we shouldn't take her literally that his body actually flies over the Abyss. "That only I can see" is a hint that this is his soul manifesting.
* Over time, the strain of the soul fragmentation is too much, and things deteriorate.
	* The start of Ch 9 indicates what's "really" happening--Their consciousnesses start to be able to mingle across space. Sometimes she perceives herself to be the human int he courtyard, other times the dragon in the black chapel. At this time, the dragon is also going mad again, resulting in MC even biting one of her guards.
	* The experiences we saw before--of decorating the chapel and of talking in the courtyard--are no longer happening. Instead of the pair being able to experience each location together, it's now more chaotic glimpses of each others' current state.
	* This is supported by the story not telling us what happens in the [[black chapel]] branch--ultimately, it ends up just being Sylus going insane. Since MC's body is at the Sanctuary, we don't see the exact events at the chapel, because it's her POV. But we do find out that the dragon is now rampaging.
* When they reunite in the valley, everything confusingly mixes together.
	* This is the cause for the "chaotic nightmares" that MC describes at the start of Ch 8, and why she temporarily can't remember why she's there--she suddenly has two sets of memories from two halves of her soul, plus some memories from Sylus's body too.
	* There are to potential explanations for this, and they're complimentary:
		* Proximity is enough for their souls to start sharing memories again, now that they're reunited
		* Because Sylus is dying, the other half of her soul is returning to her body, and bringing all the memories with it. (See below for more supporting details.)
	* The memories are hazy and fragmented between the night they exchanged souls and the night Sylus dies in her memory because each memory was made by only half a soul. This is reinforced by her talking about all the fragments feeling like a dance meant for two, but only one remains. Not only do the memories each belong to half a soul, but also Sylus is actively dying, his soul fading away.
* Ultimately, it's Sylus's "death" that gives her half of her soul back, and his (almost) fades away.
	* The sensation of his soul "passing through her" when she learns his childhood memories supports the idea that his soul is leaving.
	* When she catches the last petal, it's referred to as the last fragment of his soul.
	* She curses his soul to never fade away, which means she could feel it doing so, even the half that he'd given her.
	* The background shows flowing golden light, and while not specifically mentioned, this supports the idea of the half of her soul returning to her body.

Where this leaves the characters at the end of the myth:
* Each (mostly) has their soul back
	* MC now has at least most of her soul back, because it returned to her as Sylus died.
	* Sylus's soul likewise at least mostly is back in one piece.
	* There aren't any specific clues in one direction or the other, but thematically it would be appropriate for a little bit of their souls to remain exchanged.
* The unbreakable bond remains.
	* I mean, it's unbreakable. And since they defied fate one last time and didn't get taken into the Abyss, the bond remains.
* [[Sorceress MC]] has become a dragon, complete with horns and tail.
	* This symbolizes rebirth, as previously mentioned. Thematically, it's a nod to MC's subsequent rebirths throughout the timeline--As she becomes a dragon, it means that she achieves immortality and will be reborn again.
* [[Sorceress MC]] is alone on a ravaged planet.
	* Unless the reports of Sylus's rampage were exaggerated (which is very possible) the whole planet of Philos is pretty fucked at the moment.
* [[Sylus]]'s soul will not fade away. A dragon's roar is heard in the valley.
	* The dragon's roar occurs thematically a few times in the myth without being directly "from the lungs" of the dragon, so to speak. So, it does not necessarily mean that he's immediately reincarnated--rather, it's a sign that his soul lives on.
	* Thematically, especially given the image of MC grasping the last petal and then letting it fly onto the wind, it's fair to assume that Sylus's energy is mostly depleted. It may take his soul a long time to collect enough energy to truly resurrect.
* [[Sylus]] doesn't meet MC again until the main story timeline.
	* MC says, "It is only after my dragon is gone that I finally become one with him," implying that he's truly gone from her life. And from a storytelling perspective, this is most appropriate. Also, based on Sylus's behavior in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], there's not more history than what we see here.

**So what does [[Sorceress MC]] do next?**
This is up to personal interpretation, but pulling from the themes the story has given us, a plausible assumption is that she too awakens into a full dragon and continues her rampage of revenge across Philos, driven by her grief. Now that Sylus is gone, her appetite is truly insatiable. It's enough to drive her mad, especially since her grip on her consciousness was already weakened by the soul fragmentation and her memories from Sylus's body. So, [[Sorceress MC]] more or less "dies" when Sylus does. Her draconic body lives on, a wild and raging beast, until time or Philos's humans manage to kill her. Or, she keeps to a cave or the Abyss, sleeping and waiting for him to return, until that body turns to stone and fire. (Personally, I favor violence.)
