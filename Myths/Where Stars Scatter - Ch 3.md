# Summary
MC explores the city for a while (days or longer) and learns about the [[Great Pilgrimage]] (of which she's the "shepherd") and the [[Tree of Life]], which are supposedly how the [[revenant]]s can return to [[Philos]]. She's recognized as the [[Chosen One]] and taken to the castle by the mob. The crowd dubs her his nemesis and delivers her there to kill [[Xavier - King of Darknight]].

He lets her inside, and she calls upon his debt to get help returning to [[Philos]]. He tells her it no longer exists, but she can stay in the castle. Since it will be a very long time, they should decide what kind of "relationship" to have. While she's staying here, he accidentally feeds her poison mushroom soup and she has another flashback of the "Silver Knight", noticing his resemblance to Xavier when she comes-to. (He nursed her back to health.)

The [[revenant]]s sing her praises at night, thinking she's working on slaying Xavier, and also wage endless war on the city. Time passes as she searches the surrounding area for the [[Tree of Life]], mapping the many branching tributaries of the [[Sinders]] rivers, which are like tree roots. Along the way she helps many [[revenant]]s and develops a reputation.

She finds [[Xavier]] trying to grow a flower that shouldn't be able to grow in [[Sindersfell]] ((and its description matches [[forget-me-nots]])). He says he's tending them to remember someone, and he'll tell her who when they bloom. Finally, she picks her "relationship" to Xavier--she'll be the Queen. He accepts this deal on the condition she can make the [[forget-me-nots]] bloom.

An owl arrives with a letter from the [[Order of Babel]], inviting her to a [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] for the selection for the [[Great Pilgrimage]].
