[[Ever]]'s role in the [[Bloomshore District explosion]] is revealed--along with [[Josephine's secret notes]]

## Summary
Right after the [[Bloomshore District explosion]], the suspicious [[duckbill cap man]] that [[MC]] had seen delivers a briefcase from Josephine's house to an [[Ever]] goon, [[Raincoat 2]].

[[Raincoat 2]] examines the notes, revealing yet more secrets about the experiments on MC. Specifically, the [[Aether Core]] appeared spontaneously after MC's accidental death. 14 hours later, she resurrected, now with the [[Aether Core]]. The researchers then "killed" her a second time, and she resurrected again. Before they could do any further research, the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]] decimated the [[Gaia Research Center]], allowing Josephine to start a new life with [[MC]] (and [[Caleb]]) outside of Ever surveillance.

[[Raincoat 2]] and [[duckbill cap man]] then discuss the findings, revealing that [[duckbill cap man]] is one of the [[Backtrackers]] from future-[[Philos]], and [[Ever]] has been controlling him with the [[philosian drug]] that keeps them alive.

## Commentary

### MC's Past
This story provides a lot of information about MC's past and even the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]]. More discussion of these themes are in [[Josephine's secret notes]], [[MC#Timeline]], and [[MC#Theories#MC and the Deepspace Tunnel]].

### Onychinus's involvement
Comparing this story to the clues in [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], it's possible that [[Sherman]] and [[Onychinus]] weren't involved at all. [[Sylus]] has long been keeping an eye on [[Ever]]--he was responsible for killing an [[Ever]] researcher about 1.5 years before this story ([[01-07.01 Investigation]]). And while [[Onychinus]] certainly did have an [[Aether Core]] at this point, it's possible that it was never meant to be turned over at the [[Protocore auction]], and was instead intended as bait for [[Sylus]] the whole time.

# 01 Whispers
One of [[Ever]]'s "raincoats" meets with the [[duckbill cap man]] just after the [[Bloomshore District explosion]].
* ((We can be sure that the man in the hat is the same character because his key traits are identical across both stories--he's wearing a duckbill cap, and his voice sounds older than his appearance.))
* ((Also, I don't think this [[Ever]] hitman is the same one as [[Raincoat]] from [[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures]], given that this one is keen on getting up through the ranks and his characterization is slightly different, but I could be mistaken. So, let's call him [[Raincoat 2]] for now.))

[[Raincoat 2]] has worked with [[duckbill cap man]] before, but it's been a while. The [[duckbill cap man]] offers a briefcase that still stinks of the explosion. [[Raincoat 2]] uses a handkerchief to keep the stench off himself as he opens the case and pulls out four aged pages from 14 years ago.

# 02 "Unicorn"

This chapter is a transcript of [[Josephine's secret notes]], which provide further detail on the experiments on MC that were left out of [[Josephine's notes]]. While the full transcript is in the [[Josephine's secret notes]] page, the key information revealed here is:
* During an experiment, [[MC]] released a burst of energy and medically died, and spontaneously returned to life, along with the appearance of the [[Aether Core]] fragments in her heart
* The team voted on whether to "kill" her again to test her resurrection. Josephine is conflicted.
# 03 Observation Log
See [[Josephine's secret notes]] for the full transcript.

These notes describe how when [[MC]] came back to life, she'd lost all her memories and skills. She quickly regained cognitive skills, soon excelling past other children her age. Ultimately, the team votes to attempt to "kill" her again, and they repeat the circumstances of the first "death".

The energy is stimulated, reaches peak even faster, and causes a bigger explosion. She returns to life again, and the [[Aether Core]] is even stronger.

# 04 Post-Catastrophe Journal
See [[Josephine's secret notes]] for the full transcript.

[[MC]] escapes the lab in the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], making her way to a shelter. It seems like she may have died again, because she doesn't remember the lab or Josephine when Josephine finds her a few days later at the shelter. However, given that the next part of this segment describes her memory being shaky, it's not necessary for her to have died again for her to have forgotten the lab.

Josephine takes MC in as her own, feeling like this is a chance at redemption after allowing MC to "die" a second time. She notes that MC's memory is shaky for a while, with her frequently forgetting things. There's also a somewhat vague reference about another person in the home, which is likely meant to be [[Caleb]].
# 05 Journal Entry 4
See [[Josephine's secret notes]] for the full transcript.

About 3mo after the catastrophe, Josephine notes that MC's memory is stabilizing, and hopes that's because the [[Aether Core]] is also stable. She wants to check in with her fellow researchers, but can't get into contact with any of them. ((This ends up being a blessing, as they're able to escape [[Ever]]'s surveillance.)) So, she turns to [[Dr. Noah]] for help ensuring that [[MC]]'s heart is stable.

# 06 Dust
[[Raincoat 2]] isn't entirely satisfied with the four papers, asking "Is this it?" 
* ((Since we are given the full transcript of these four papers, we can infer that the papers that [[Grandma]] left MC, i.e. [[Josephine's notes]], are the "missing" pieces that [[Raincoat 2]] is expecting to see here.))

The [[duckbill cap man]] counters that it's "enough for you to confirm her identity and role."

[[Raincoat 2]] affirms that he's silenced Josephine and retrieved the research material, so he gives [[duckbill cap man]] his reward--a vial. ((This is the [[philosian drug]].))

[[Raincoat 2]] then tucks the papers away and returns the briefcase to [[duckbill cap man]], warning him that the smell of the explosion makes him a suspect. 

The [[duckbill cap man]] confirms that the drug in the vial is correct, then asks when [[Ever]] is going to go after MC. [[Raincoat 2]] reports that there's no hurry, since her powers aren't complete yet. He also says "your Prince Xavier" has been watching over her, and asks whether "people still practice feudalism where you're from," calling it a "regression". ((A reference to [[Philos]] being in the future, and the [[Backtrackers]] having traveled back in time.))

[[duckbill cap man]] responds that [[Xavier]] is too busy "dealing with his own issues" (hinting at the [[traps for Xavier]]), and warns [[Raincoat 2]] that [[Ever]] isn't the only group that wants her, and they may lose their chance if they don't strike quickly.

[[Raincoat 2]] replies, "The one who strikes first is helping her [[cultivation]]." He nudges [[duckbill cap man]] about getting rid of [[Xavier]], saying "Isn't internal struggle your speciality?" and suggesting he kill [[Xavier]] and have [[Ever]] crown him as prince.

[[duckbill cap man]] then threatens [[Raincoat 2]] with a light blade, and reveals that his hands are wrinkled. He says, "I can't kill [[Xavier]], but I can do more than deal with a two-legged carbon-based monkey like you." [[Raincoat 2]] replies, "Kill me, then. But how long can you survive in this era?" referring to the [[philosian drug]].

[[duckbill cap man]] drops him, then reiterates his warning to get to her quickly, saying "her existence isn't as simple as the observation records suggest" and if they keep stalling "[[Ever]] will end up with more than they bargained for once she develops." [[duckbill cap man]] then leaves.

[[Raincoat 2]] then scoffs, saying "[[Backtrackers]] my ass" and "By seniority, I'm your ancestor." His POV also reveals that they've been mixing a substance into the [[philosian drug]] which [[duckbill cap man]] hasn't het discovered.

> According to [[Ever]]'s plan, if they can control that Backtracker with that drug, then controlling [[Xavier]] shouldn't be far off.

[[Raincoat 2]] has aspirations of beating the other "Raincoats" and joining the real plan. ((This is a key reason why I don't think he's the same as [[Raincoat]].))

> Since Unicorn's power isn't complete yet, it's perfectly fine to let her absorb some power--[[Xavier]]'s, specifically. Letting his lightblade serve her and becoming the strongest weapon in her hands is something the [[Resonance Evol]] can easily achieve. Xavier will surely give her every bit of himself.
