# Summary
After the successful surgery, the [[Metaflux]] abruptly disappears. [[Zayne]] and [[MC]] regroup in the lounge, bantering and expressing veiled concern. Zayne reveals he always knew MC was there for an [[Aether Core]] investigation, and the fluctuations today weren't normal.

MC reflects it's her first time seeing him in surgery--and she also got to see him do surgery on a sandwich.

A call comes in, and Zayne is shocked to hear the patient is already awake.

## Commentary
Zayne hints more here that he knows more about the [[Aether Core]](s) than he's let on. Or, at least, he has his hunches.

# Details
MC is able to suppress the [[Metaflux]] and the surgery finishes successfully. As soon as it's done, the [[Metaflux]] vanishes.

In the lounge, Zayne offers to do an Evol examination for MC, using patches attached to her fingers. She says she feels fine, but he knows she pushed herself. He reveals that he knows that the [[Metaflux]] wasn't the kind that an ordinary [[Wanderer]] could generate, and that MC is also there due to the [[Aether Core]] investigation.

Remember that [[Zayne]] worked under [[Dr. Noah]] and has known about [[Aether Core]]s for a while, she loosens up. She wonders if the [[human-like Wanderer]]s were also created by the Aether Core. But Zayne says an [[Aether Core]] alone wouldn't cause mutation (MC has no problems with hers). Zayne suspects "someone attempted to be smart, but ended up failing in the process."

Zayne adds:
> In this world, many forces covet the [[Aether Core]]. You have'nt met all of them yet.

MC's Evol reading is normal. Zayne is relieved, and they banter a bit. Today was her first time seeing him perform surgery. As he picks the wilted toppings off a hospital sandwich, she remarks that she's also seeing him perform sandwich surgery.

She asks if there's anything he can't do, and he admits that he's not very good at taking compliments in front of her.

Zayne hands her the sandwich and checks a medical group chat, revealing that some glassware was cracked when MC's target suddenly disappeared and she couldn't contain all the energy. Zayne teases her lightly for overdoing it.

Zayne gets a call and is shocked to hear that the patient woke up already.
