# Summary

Concurrent with [[Operation Aether Ordeal]], [[MC]] gets a lead on strange [[Wanderer]] occurrences in a [[small country in the south]]. Commercial airflight isn't possible due to the [[Protofield]] disturbances, so after getting a tip from [[Luke and Kieran]] that Sylus is heading to the same place, she tries to get him to take her with him.

He initially declines, but she insists that he hasn't given her a chance to demonstrate if she'll be a liability or not. He agrees to give her three days, and if she can prove herself, he'll take her along.

She expects to stay at [[Sylus's base]], but he leads her out to a black sports car instead. (See also [[Sylus's vehicles]])

## Commentary

### Relationship Timeline
[[Operation Aether Ordeal]] begins shortly after [[MC]] leaves the [[N109 Zone]], and goes on for about three months before the events of [[04 Homecoming Wings]].

We know several memories have already happened:
* [[Razor's Grip]] introduces Sylus's private jet
* [[Razor's Dance]] is the turning point where MC stops rejecting Sylus showing up in her life.
	* [[Continuous Symphony]] most likely occurs before [[Razor's Dance]], and shows MC slowly remembering more from their previous life.

### Tables have turned
Initially, Sylus was showing up in MC's life. As she expressed her displeasure, he backed off significantly in [[Razor's Dance]]. Now, MC is the one showing up in [[Sylus]]'s life, wanting to be let in more. Sylus resists--not necessarily because he doesn't want her around, but because he's still adjusting and letting her set the pace. He's curious to see how hard she'll push if he provides some resistance, and he's giving her a chance to prove not just her combat abilities, but also that she actually wants to be around him.

# Details

> Recently, a [[small country in the south]] has experience abnormal magnetic [[fluctuation]] and a surge in [[Wanderer]]s. I suspect it's related to the [[Aether Core]] and want to go investigate.
* ((This places this memory within the timeframe of [[Operation Aether Ordeal]].))

As Sylus sits in the armory ([[Onychinus base armory]]) on a couch assembling a gun, he asks why MC is also interested about [[Wanderer]]s overseas. She reveals she already knows he's heading to that country soon. Sylus's eyes narrow.

> Sylus: I should prepare a few rounds for the moles who leaked my plans, huh. Two should do the trick.
* ((ie he's blaming [[Luke and Kieran]]))

MC clarifies that due to the area's erratic [[Protofield]], commercial flights aren't an option.
* ((Thus, this memory is also after [[Razor's Grip]] which first introduces Sylus's private jet.))

As Sylus declines her request and they banter, Sylus offhandedly mentions "a lot of time has passed since our last meeting."

> Sylus: My "business" isn't what normal people imagine it to be. So taking someone who's not used to my way of life is like carrying a firearm that doesn't fit in your hand. It can be a liability.
> *Defiant, I place the gun case on the floor. It's an obstacle between Sylus and the door. I look up at him.*
> MC: Except you never let me into your life. How would you know whether I'm used to it or not?
> Sylus quickly gives me a once-over.
> Sylus: Are you sure?
> MC: If I prove myself to not be a liability, you take me with you. Well?
> *Sylus's red eyes move closer. And closer.* *I lean back against the door, unwittingly holding my breath.*
> MC: What are you doing...
> *His hand passes by my ear. And then he opens the door.*
> Sylus: Are you just going to stand there?
> MC: ... Did you really have to be so close... to open a door?
> Sylus: Didn't you say you wanted to be let into my life? If so, you should get used to this.
> *I pause, then quickly catch up to Sylus.*
> MC: So it's a yes?
> Sylus: We have three days before we set off. If you can keep up, there will be a place for you on the jet.
> MC: Deal.

MC goes to prove her knowledge of Sylus's territory, pointing out Sylus's bedroom and a guest room she's used before, assuming she'll use it again. But instead, he leads her outside to a black sports car.
