# Summary

[[MC]] learns more about the [[Tezcatlipoca]], and especially its connection to [[Lumiere]]. She briefly wonders if [[Xavier]] might be [[Lumiere]], but is easily thrown off the trail by the fact that [[Lumiere]] would have to be in his 40s by now. [[Xavier]] asks why she's interested.

[[MC]] and [[Xavier]] stop by a convenience store to eat [[White Bear]] instant noodles a little after 1am.

MC looks up the [[Tezcatlipoca]] online, learning that [[Lumiere]] killed the last one seen 14 years ago. (See the [[Tezcatlipoca]] page for more details.)

MC "jokingly" confronts [[Xavier]] about whether he's [[Lumiere]]. He looks surprised for a moment, but then casually brushes it off, stating that [[Lumiere]] would have to be in his 40s by now, and rumor has it he's a [[Tenebra]] now.

MC ironically tells [[Xavier]] not to jump to conclusions, then claims to have been joking, since Xavier clearly isn't old enough.

He asks why she wants to meet him, and she says she's just trying her luck, and shows him the info on her phone.
