# Summary
Once in the row boat, [[Rafayel]] reveals that their destination is [[Hat Island]]. He says there's a [[Wanderer]] there with a [[Protocore]] he wants, and he claims to need it for paint, though MC sees through this flimsy excuse.

Despite it being close by, the row boat proves to be a poor choice, and they end up capsizing and swimming the rest of the way. Once on the island, [[Rafayel]] suggests they start with the mountain.

# Details
Once on the boat, [[MC]] is miffed that they're rowing instead of having gotten a speed boat. [[Rafayel]] reveals that their destination is [[Hat Island]]. Specifically, he needs [[MC]]'s help fetching a certain [[Wanderer]]'s [[Protocore]], claiming he'll use it for paints.

MC's not buying the lie, so he distracts her by changing the subject to why it's taking them so long to get to the island, accusing MC of rowing in circles. MC turns the accusation back around at Rafayel, and he blames the oar. Complaining at the delay he suggests they just swim.

Larger waves come for them then, filling the boat with water. [[Rafayel]] gets seasick.

They end up having to swim the rest of the way and wash up on the shore. Rafayel complains dramatically about their predicament while MC's [[Hunter's Watch]] scans and detects no fluctuations.

Suddenly Rafayel is ready to be on-task again, saying they have a full day ahead of them and will start at the mountain.
