# Summary
[[MC]] and [[Zayne]] arrive at [[Dr. Noah]]'s. [[Pie]]'s unusual intelligence (that of a nine-year-old) and an assortment of other critters running about, along with a whiff of [[Metaflux]], hint at some of [[Dr. Noah]]'s research.

Recognizing MC, he invites her and [[Zayne]] in from the cold.

# Details
[[MC]] treats [[Pie]] to some canned pet food that [[Zayne]] had brought. Zayne reveals that the little fox isn't ordinary--he's as intelligent as a nine-year-old child.

They soon arrive at [[Dr. Noah]]'s house, where the doctor immediately ropes [[Zayne]] into helping with the little animals scurrying about.

MC senses a hint of [[Metaflux]] in the air from the animals. Zayne easily catches the escapees with ice cages.

Referencing the escaped animals, Zayne says, "Does the agonist no longer work?"

Dr Noah replies, "Its effectiveness was shortened by a week. It seems the [[Metaflux]] around this area is increasing again."

[[Dr. Noah]] recognizes MC and invites her inside.
