This page is meant to be a helpful summary of some of the things to be thinking about when attempting to use visual clues in interpreting Love and Deepspace lore.

In short, it's important to be cautious of using visual clues (such as the background) when trying to parse Love and Deepspace lore, largely because assets often get re-used or are developed in parallel with the writing team and therefore not always 100% aligned with what's written. Usually, what's written should take precedence.

# Context

## Parallel Development
Especially for a game with as many moving pieces as Love and Deepspace, different parts of the game are often developed in parallel. For example, the visual designers may be refining and developing character outfits at the same time that the writing teams are creating new story content. This means that these teams won't always be in lock-step. Even when they're trying to be, miscommunications still happen.

## Content has to be re-used
It's tempting to look to the background as the source-of-truth for the location, but if you watch closely you'll notice that certain backgrounds get re-used frequently, especially within the same LI's content. For example, the background of a gambling table first used for [[Elysium]] reappears whenever a "gambling"-themed room is needed.

Writers may be coming up with new and interesting locales, but if the broader development team decides there's not resources to make a new background or outfit asset, the closest fit will be used.

You'll especially see this whenever a character needs to wear a mask. For example in [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]], [[Rafayel]]'s masquerade mask is described as covering much more of his face and is much more elaborate than the asset that's shown, which just covers his eye. In this case, the writers wanted to depict a specific mask, but for whatever reason, the visual design team wasn't able to supply this, so they chose the next best thing.

## Seasons are intentionally vague
With the exception of seeing snow on screen, generally avoid assuming the season based on the visuals used. The writers are often intentionally vague about the season, since this gives them the most flexibility. Seasons that are stated in the writing can usually be trusted, but there can still be discrepancies to be mindful of.

# Writing takes precedence (usually)
If you read closely, you'll notice a fair number of (usually small) discrepancies between the game's writing and its visuals--such as MC reaching out to straighten an LI's tie when their game model is wearing a sweater.

When there are discrepancies between what's written and what's shown, you should *usually* defer to what's written. For example, in [[Beyond Cloudfall]], a [[Sanctuary]] background shows dragon statues despite [[Sorceress MC]] saying that no images of dragons are allowed in the Sanctuary aside from the mural of the [[Sacred Judicator]]. In this case, the writing should take precedence and we should understand the "canon" [[Sanctuary]] to not have any dragon statues.

However, there are exceptions to this pattern. In [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], [[MC]] refers to seeing [[Luke and Kieran]]'s expressions and their eyes--though it's firmly in canon that they're wearing their full-face masks at this point. ([[WU-10 Mischief]] describes the origins of these masks.) In this case, it seems that some of the writing pre-dates the canon decision to give Luke and Kieran masks, so the visual should take precedence here (especially since it's supported by the canon story [[WU-10 Mischief]]).
