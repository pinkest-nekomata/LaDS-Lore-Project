Zayne's character has recurring themes of accepting death, the natural duration of life, and the [[Grim Reaper]].

Notably, he is a fate diety in both of his myths. Especially in [[Zayne's ancient china myth]], he's a deity whose job it is to decide how long each life should be, and to ensure that the laws of fate are upheld.

As a doctor, he and [[Greyson]] have a poignant moment where [[Greyson]] wonders if the families of the deceased see them as guardian angels or the [[Grim Reaper]]. Zayne is silent in answer, reflecting on the little [[snow velvet]] that is now infected with [[black crystals]] and therefore beyond saving. ([[WU-09 No Morning#05 A Long Night]])

This is mirrored in the [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] timeline, where Zayne's role is killing people who've started to transform, thus cutting their lives short at the right time. ([[Still In Dark]])

Especially in [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs#03 Undying Tree]], we see [[Zayne]] stand fast to his belief that death is a part of life, and they have to accept that. Trying to extend live beyond death is dangerous and that line shouldn't be crossed. This is fitting with his overall themes as a character.

Notably, in both his myths, [[Zayne]] breaks his own rules to save [[MC]] and extend her life, thus defying fate. In both cases, he takes on the consequences for his actions, so even though he's "going against" fate, he's still taking responsibility for this deviation.

[[Carter]] serves as a contrast--we see in [[WU-02 Snowy Stairs]] that [[Carter]] is unwilling to accept death as inevitable, and in his efforts to subvert it, he causes much harm.

[[Zayne's notebook]] holds etched tally marks on the cover of all the lives he's "failed" to save, and he remembers the circumstances of each death in excruciating detail.
