# Summary

[[Chosen One MC]] washes up on the shore of the [[Sinders]], the major river system in [[Sindersfell]], a shadow of [[Philos]] occupied by undead [[revenant]]s who resurrect with every Blood Moon and their "Mad King" and "Tyrant" [[Xavier - King of Darknight]].

Acolytes of the [[Order of Babel]], lead by a [[Bishop]], bring her to a monastery where [[Xavier - King of Darknight]] finds her. Though he recognizes her, he holds her at swordpoint demands that she tell him who she is. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 1]]) He reveals that she's the only one living in the land of the Dead, then disappears.

She walks by moonlight nights and meets more [[revenant]]s, including a group of knights who attack her. Xavier appears again, saving her ([[Nightvow Mooncurse]] kindled scene). The ferryman is introduced, then they cross the Sinders and arrive at the city of [[Sindersfell]], where Xavier leaves her. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 2]])

MC explores and learns more of the city's lore, then eventually is shepherded to the castle by the [[revenant]]s who want her to kill [[Xavier]]. Instead she spends time with Xavier, agreeing to help him try to get [[forget-me-nots]] to bloom (despite not knowing what type of flower they are or that he wants to tend them in memory of her). She maps out the surrounding area, searching for the [[Tree of Life]] and gaining a reputation for kind deeds until she's invited to the [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] for the [[Great Pilgrimage]]. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 3]])

At the [[Order of Babel]] monastary, she explores their library, learning about her past life as [[Queen MC]] but not knowing it's her own history. [[Xavier]] also discusses Philos's history with her. At the ceremony, she experiences fragmented memories of her own coronation as [[Queen MC]] and the later life of [[Xavier - Lightseeker]] in the timeline where he returns from the [[Traceback II]] mission and tries to find her. Meanwhile, the [[revenant]]s on the pilgrimage are swallowed by a whirlpool. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 5]])

MC awakes from her flashbacks by the river, and finds [[Xavier]] in a similarly memory-confused state. Thinking himself dreaming, he confesses that he wasn't direct enough and didn't make her intentions clear, and makes the very ironic statement:
> "When we last saw each other, you said you had feelings for someone. It doesn't matter to me, yet... Why wasn't that person by your side when you were in danger?"

(He was that person.) He then kisses her somewhat forcefully, but later doesn't remember this exchange at all. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 6]]) Back at the castle, MC convinces the ferryman to let her borrow his boat so that she can try to find the revenants who disappeared. She and [[Xavier]] go on a quest to the [[Heart of the Planet]] and learn of the false [[Tree of Life]] made of corpses. Xavier summarizes the truth of [[Philos]]'s immortality, and how it was sustained by sacrifices. The revenants now parody this sacrifice yet again, slowly joining the tree of corpses or becoming [[Wanderer]]s. MC remembers her true identity as [[Queen MC]]. ([[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 7]])

It's revealed that either MC or Xavier can sacrifice themselves to the planet's core to keep it alive. Xavier lies to MC one more time by telling her that they'll see each other tomorrow as she falls asleep, but he actually sends her in the boat to the [[Heart of the Planet]] with a [[Protocore]] fragment so that she can escape back to [[Philos]].

There, she meets the true [[Tree of Life]], which gives her a choice. She can either stay in this "false branch" version of [[Philos]], or make the risky decision to go back in time, which has no guarantee of success. She, of course, decides to go back and try to find a new path where she can save [[Xavier]]. ([[Where Stars Scatter - Ch 8]])

As the tree warned, this triggers the collapse of the current plane. With her limited remaining time, [[Chosen One MC]] goes to find [[Xavier]] as he battles the revenants. His power wanes, but she resonates with him, allowing him to complete his final stand. The sun breaks through the endless night, turning the rest of the [[revenant]]s to crystals and Wanderers, which they then cut down together. Finally, they collapse on the pile of corpses.

For a moment, they have a vision of a field of endless flowers. They sit together, sharing a peaceful moment and a kiss. Then the scene suddenly cuts back to the devastation of the battle. They effectively die in each other's arms as the "false branch" of [[Sindersfell]] collapses.

The [[Tree of Life]] sends [[Chosen One MC]] back in time, thanking her for saving Xavier. We see flashbacks of Xavier's life, including talk of the [[Traceback I]] mission and his conversation with his mother when he was choosing a sword as his weapon, where she told him to wield his sword for the choices he's made with his own free will.

This time, thanks to the divergence point [[Xavier]] created with the [[Traceback II]] mission, they're both on their way to the version of the timeline where they reunite on Earth before its death. This means a new future is finally possible.

# Commentary

## Key themes
The central theme of this myth is the idea that memories prove our existence, and stories are a type of memory. The 'false' eternity that Philosians pursued is one of stagnancy, where the same individuals remain alive forever.

'True' eternity is possible through stories, where humans keep each others' unmet dreams and unsolved mysteries alive, to eventually find fruition through the stories we tell each other and the memories we preserve of the past.
