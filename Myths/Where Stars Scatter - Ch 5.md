# Summary
MC tends to the "unnamed" flowers ([[forget-me-nots]]) until the full moon and the [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] which is attended by thousands of [[revenant]]s. (This is the 36th moonlit night.) They speak to some, and Xavier hints at the cost of [[Philos]]'s prior immortality ((i.e. sacrificing MC over and over)). He talks a bit more about [[Queen MC]]'s reign, and how the people forgot her and betrayed her memory when she "disappeared". He says this MC was destined to fail as the chosen one the second she gave the [[revenant]]s a modicum of pity.

The Ferryman and [[Xavier]] have a cryptic conversation, revealing that Xavier knows who MC really is, and expects that she won't remember. The Ferryman asks what Xavier will do when she "can't continue", and he says by the time it happens, he'll be prepared.

MC looks for [[Xavier]], and notices that the [[Pilgrimage Ceremony]] feels strangely familiar. With sudden pain in her chest, she has a flashback to her coronation ceremony as [[Queen MC]], including [[Jeremiah]]. Then she remembers an authoritative voice telling her that the [[Aether Core]] in her heart can save [[Philos]] from destruction.

When she comes to, her memories are fragmented. She goes to the river, where spirits try to drag her in, then she sees [[Xavier - Lightseeker]] and remembers him. Then icy arms drag her under the surface.

The river swallows a boat of [[revenant]]s in a whirlpool, never to return.

## Commentary

# Details
The revenants come up with a rumor that MC is reforming the [[Mad King]], and she "confirms" it.
> Lively Revenant: That's wonderful. May Philos prosper under eternity's divine gaze.
> MC: (Why do the revenants always say weird things...)
> *Ready to depart, I pull on Xavier's sleeve. Yet he opens his mouth.*
> Xavier: What if your eternity's foundation involves sacrificing others?
> Lively Revenant: Nonsense. [[Philos]] is the embodiment of eternity, and everyone possesses an immortal soul.
* ((This is a direct reference to [[Shooting Stars]] and how this version of [[Philos]] sustained immortality by sacrificing MC repeatedly.))

When MC probes more about the fate of [[Queen MC]]:
> Xavier: In the beginning, her statues decorated every street. Some were dissatisfied with her conduct, but most adored her. They believed she would be the Chosen One who'd lead Philos to its rebirth. She was the key Philos needed to obtain true eternity.
> MC: And then?
> Xavier: Are you asking what happened? She "disappeared." No one knew where she went. For a hundred years, the people thought she abandoned them. For the hundred years after that, the people slowly forgot about her. Another hundred years passed. Her portraits were burned, and her statues were destroyed. They became the stones that paved the royal capital's plaza.

He says the sacrifice was insignificant, and she takes this to mean he's saying she shouldn't put herself on the line to be the [[Chosen One]] now, either.

Xavier and the Ferryman have a cryptic conversation:
> Ferryman: You keep her close. Are you afraid she'll recognize you? Or are you afraid she won't?
> Xavier: She won't remember.
> Ferryman: ...It won't be long until the Apocalypse arrives. After this Pilgrimage Ceremony, the river might grow again. And it might reach the Tree of Life. Do you want to be a witness to that?
> Xavier: Should they find a method to return, they'll see Philos is no longer the place they imagine it to be.
> \[...]
> Ferryman: And her? What will you do when she can't continue?
> Xavier: ...
> Ferryman: At long last, there is something beyond your expectations.
> Xavier: When the time comes, I'll have already made my preparations.
> *Seeing that he doesn't want to discuss it any further, the ferryman sighs and says nothing.*
> Ferryman: Don't you owe me six fares now, boy?
> Xavier: Your memory is getting worse. It's seven.
> Ferryman: ...Hmph. Centuries have passed, yet l've never seen anyone pay your fare except for her. Where to? I won't ask for a coin this time.

When MC has her coronation flashback, the "Familiar Voice" is [[Jeremiah]]. He talks about how many flowers Xavier ordered, and the children he hired to scatter them.
