A trope in [[Xianxia]] and [[Wuxia]] novels.

From [Immortal Mountain](https://immortalmountain.wordpress.com/glossary/wuxia-xianxia-xuanhuan-terms/):

> **Heavenly Tribulation** (天劫 tiānjié) (重劫 zhòngjié) – in some novels, a trial encountered by cultivators at key points in their [[cultivation]], which they must resist and ultimately transcend. Because immortal cultivation (generally) goes against the Will of Heaven, the Heavens will send down tribulations to oppress high-level cultivators who make progress towards Immortality, often right when they enter a new cultivation stage. This typically takes the form of a lightning storm, with extraordinarily powerful bolts of lightning raining down from the Heavens to strike at the cultivator.

The punishment of [[Sorceress MC]] in [[Beyond Cloudfall - Ch 9]] invokes this trope. She has gone against the Will of Heaven by rejecting her fate to kill the Fiend. By cultivating her desire and trading half her soul with an immortal, she's reached a new milestone in her cultivation, and thus has this trial to overcome.
