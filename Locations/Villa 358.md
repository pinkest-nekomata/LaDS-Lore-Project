Features in [[Tender Curve]]. In the [[Linkon]] suburbs. Has a gate, a garden, and a porch. MC calls it an "abandoned villa". 

A mother cat lives nearby, and she's had at least one litter of kittens. All but one of that litter died by two months, and Sylus stops by to feed that kitten and its mother in [[Tender Curve]].
