# Memory
*LI:* [[Sylus]]
*Rarity:* n/a
*Type:* Bond

**Description**
> I have to get the brooch within 24 hours so that [[Sylus]] will allow me to go to the auction and look for the [[Aether Core]]... if Sylus believes he can stop me, HE IS WRONG
## Key Info
* MC makes a series of bungled attempts to locate the brooch
* Sylus enjoys reading and listening to classical music records
* MC overhears a phone call of a man telling [[Sylus]] he has a list of everyone who was at [[The Nest]] "that night"
* [[Luke and Kieran]] trick MC and send her in with "evol sealing handcuffs" (regular handcuffs) and "a tranquilizer gun" (it shoots out a cloud in the shape of a heart and confetti)
* MC finally gets the brooch, "barely" passing Sylus's test and earning her ticket to the [[Protocore auction]]

## Commentary
### Win condition
Based on Sylus's comments at the end of the story, he's both testing her and was hoping this would be an amusing game. But he's bored by her so-called "methods"--especially that she keeps trying the same thing and failing.

When she's checking his lapel at the end, she seems to have already gone over the area she later finds the brooch. It's also not in a pocket, nor is it pinned in. Almost certainly, this is meant to imply that Sylus moved the brooch with his mist, and he places it there so that she can find it at the end, effectively letting her win. He only does this after the player chooses the dialogue option of "Do you like me" or "Do you hate me".

We can infer that Sylus cared more about *how* she was going to go about her task than whether she'd "find" the brooch. She also tries only one approach--physically looking for it--instead of attempting to appeal to Sylus in other ways or bargain with him. She also takes a more hostile approach to Mephisto vs. trying to team up with him. But still, she shows determination. Ultimately, she "passes" because she didn't give up. ((This could remind him of her climbing out of the top of the cave in [[Beyond Cloudfall]].))

# Details
Picks up where [[02-02.06 Agreement]] left off.

> `Sylus is showering. Steam fogs the otherwise clear glass into the shower.`
> `Mephisto perches nearby.`
> `MC digs frantically around his room. She opens a drawer, then closes it in frustration. She checks the pockets of the neatly folded black shirt and crmson robe on the bed.
> MC: Huh? Don't tell me... Not in this pocket... or this one either... It's not here `(looking at the bed)` or there `(looking at the nightstand)`!  It's gone! `(scanning the room)` I searched every nook and cranny... Where else could it be? Did he... take it into the bathroom?
> `MC eyes Mephisto on his perch.`
> MC: `(Pointing at him and stalking closer.)` Tell me, did you eat it? `(She picks him up and shakes the bird. He caws angrily.)` Yes or no? `(Hears the water turn off)` Damn it! I need to hide...
> `The glass shower door slides open and Sylus walks out in a towel.`
> MC: (Ugh, why does he have to come out now...)
> `Sylus walks towards the phone by the bed. MC hides behind a piece of furniture.`
> MC: (Now's my chance to escape!)
> `She starts to creep towards the door, but then the phone rings. MC dives back behind the furniture.`
> Man on the phone: Mr. Sylus, we found a list of all the attendees from that night at [[The Nest]].
> Sylus: Hmm.
> Man: About that night...
> MC: (That night at The Nest? Does it involve me?)
> `MC creeps closer to the phone. Sylus huffs as he sees her, and she looks up to see him staring right at her, his hand on the furniture between them.`
> MC: ...!
> `Sylus's surprise turns to a wicked smirk.`
> Man: Mr Sylus?
> Sylus: It's nothing. Just a stray cat who happened to barge in.
> `Mist wraps MC's wrists and lifts her off the floor.`
> Man: ...A cat?
> MC: `(yelps)` You didn't need to do that, I'll-- `(struggles)`
> Man: Uh... I'll leave you alone now...!"
> `Sylus sets her back down behind the furniture.`

Later, Sylus is skimming over records on the shelves. He wears the red robe with the black lapels. Record names include: Whirling Cave, Space Mountain, You've only seen a peep through the curtain.
> Sylus: This is the fourth time we've met since last night, kitten.
> `MC is handcuffed by mist again, sitting and pouting behind him.`
> MC: ...You set a time limit for finding the brooch, but you didn't say how I should find it. I doubt I'm breaking any rules.
* ((According to my memory of a translation note that's been taken down, her phrasing here in CN references the same word "methods" that Sylus used before and in the next line. So instead of "you didn't say how I should find it", the translation "You didn't say what methods I could use" preserves the intended call-backs.))
> Sylus: Do I need to remind you about your so-called "methods" from before?

> `Sylus is sitting and reading in a leather couch, wearing glasses.`
> Sylus: Get out.
> MC: `Looking down at her mist-cuffed hands` Hmph. Aw....

> `Sylus is wearing the black shirt and black pants, dusting a shelf.`
> Sylus: Leave.
> MC: Ugh... I was caught again...

> `MC racks the slide of a pistol, turning to face up the hallway. As she does, Sylus's slippered feet come into view.`
> MC: This time for sure, I'll...
> `MC looks up and gives a soft yelp. Sylus sighs wearily.`
> MC: I know. I'll go now.

Sylus puts the record he selected on the player.
> Sylus: Have I underestimated your determination or overestimated your intellect.
> MC: `(Scoffs, looks down at cuffed hands)` You're the one who suggested making a deal. But here you are making things difficult--
> Sylus: `(Walking toward her)` You'll have to work harder.
> `He grabs her wrist, the mist falling away, and drags her toward the door.`
> MC: L-let go...! What are you doing?
> `He shoves her out the door.`
> Sylus: Leave. I'm going to bed.
> MC: You?!
> Mephisto: Caw caw!
> Sylus: `(hmphs and glares at the bird)` You too.

In the living room, MC scribbles out doodles she's made in a daily planner. Mephisto holding a knife by the blade, Mephisto flexing, and Sylus as a demon with horns and a pointed tail, and Mephisto on his shoulder.
> MC: Bastard! Now I get it. He never intended to make a deal with me in the first place!
> `Kieran sits on the table across from her, Luke sits at it.`
> Kieran: You're pulling your hair over this, huh? If you want to do something, maybe we can help you.
> `Luke nods.`
> MC: `(raising a fist)` What do you mean?
> Luke: If you want to conquer our boss's heart, you'll have to use a different approach. `(Pulls out a paperback book, flips it open.)` "For some people, they get bored once they have everything. So only those who dare to challenge their authority can catch their interest." `(Closes the book, sets it on the table and slides it towards her.)`
* ((Note that this is exactly how [[Luke and Kieran]] got [[Sylus]]'s attention in [[WU-10 Mischief]].))

> `MC gets up and walks over. The title is now visible as Humanity and Conquest.`
> Kieran: `(Speaking from memory)` "When you're dealing with such a person, you bow down and submit or take them out in one go. In other words--"
> `Metal clatters to the table in front of her, and she looks past the book to see handcuffs and a pink and blue painted gun.`
> Luke and Kieran: Strike when they're off guard! `(Luke makes claws with his hands.)`
> Keiran: Boss is the least guarded when he's sleeping.
> Luke: You only have one shot. Don't waste this chance. Just do it!
> MC: `(skeptical)` Hm...
> *Three hours later...*
> `MC stands outside the double doors to Sylus's bedroom.`
> MC: Evol-sealing handcuffs and a tranquilizer gun... This is a terrible idea. I'm gonna get killed the moment I try it. ...I don't have much time left. And it's not like I plan to sit around doing nothing, so I might as well try.
* ((Accordng to my memory of a translation note that's been taken down, the CN has the connotation of "It's better than sitting around waiting to die".))

> `MC walks confidently into the room. Sylus is indeed sleeping, in his robe, sitting upright against the headboard. She creeps up onto the bed.`
> MC: `(Whispering)` Sylus... Sylus?
> `Satisfied that he's asleep, she quickly acts to handcuff his left hand to the headboard's filigree. She laughs to herself.`
> MC: `(Whispering)` This is exactly what you get for all the terrible things you do!
> `Sylus still appears to be sleeping, so MC's hand drifts lower as she decides where in the robe to search. Then his hand catches her wrist and she looks up to see his eyes open.`
> MC: !!!
> Sylus: `(Slight smirl)` Hmph. Showing up uninvited at this hour, want me to tell you a bedtime story?
* ((Given Sylus's schedule, 'at this hour' means the middle of the day))

> `He drops her wrist.`
> MC: Obviously, I'm... Hmph. Actually... `(Glancing at the handcuffs)` *You* should be the one to figure out what's going on here. `(Braces her right hand against the headboard by his head. Leans closer.)` These handcuffs nullify a person's Evol for an hour. No matter how powerful you are, you're helpless as of right now.
* (([[Sorceress MC]] pulls a similar trick (and has similar consequences) in [[Bloodnight Blaze]]))

> Sylus: Really? What do you plan to do then, since I've become your prey?
> MC: `(Slight laugh, holds out her hand.)` Where's the broach?
> Sylus: `(Smirks, huffs. Gestures at himself with his free hand.) Help yourself.
> MC: Hm. Don't mind if I do. `(searches his left lapel)` From the beginning, you trapped me here, forced me to resonate with you, and even said we're "the same"... `(patting down by his ribs)` One wouldn't treat a stranger like that, so...

`Dialogue Branch 1`
> MC: You don't like me--or should I say--hate me.
> Sylus:  `(Scoffs, vague smile, brow raise.) Astonishing misunderstanding.`

`Dialogue Branch 2`
> MC: Don't tell me you like me? Is this all so you can get my attention?
> Sylus: `(Scoffs with a smile, glances away)` Clearly you've read too many fairy tales.

> MC: `(Continues searching his lapel)`
> Sylus: Does my answer matter?
> MC: Hm? `(Pulls out the brooch from a spot she seemed to have checked before. Laughs with victory.)` Now it's not important at all. `(Flips the brooch like a coin and catches it.)`
> Sylus: `(Scoff/laugh)`
> MC: `(angrily)` Don't tell me...
> Sylus: I won't go back on what I promised you. However, games are fun because of how thrilling they can be. Your attitude makes things... boring. `(Red mist makes the handcuffs glow, then they snap open.)`
> MC: `(gasps)` Ugh, you!
> `MC goes to scramble backwards, but Sylus easily pushes upright and throws her against the bed. As he leans over her, she raises her left arm, but he grabs her by the wrist and pulls it aside.`
> Sylus: You're pretty good at running away. `(metal clicks, and he picks up the 'tranquilizer gun' with a scoff.)` Are you using this on me? `(Furrows his brow and shakes his head, mocking)` So brash, aren't you?
> `Sylus lightly tosses the gun onto the bed, then his right hand falls on the bed above MC's left hand which clutches the brooch.`
> Sylus: I'm keeping you around because you're still useful. And... I truly enjoy watching my little prey... `(His hand closers over hers holding the brooch. She tries to push him off, arm trembling, but can't)` ...struggle. `(He pulls her hand between them.)` Especially when it thinks it can escape from me. `(Smirking)`
> MC: Let me go! I already have it!
> `MC tries to pull her hand away and Sylus pushes it back to the bed--hitting the gun. It goes off, and confetti bursts out of it. A heart-shaped smoke cloud hangs in the air above them as confetti falls. "Love" is written with negative space inside it.`
> Sylus: `(Scoffs and sighs.)` You're so gullible, kitten.
* ((According to [[lost tr source]], in the original CN he calls her taste tacky here instead of inferring the twins were responsible. Personally, I love the localization here.))

> MC: (Those two, they obviously...)
> Sylus: `(Half-laugh.) He pulls the brooch from her hand, then flicks the clasp open.
> MC: `(gasps)`
> Sylus: Don't move. `(pins the brooch to her shirt)`
> MC: Does this count as... passing your test?
> Sylus: Barely. The auction is about to start, but what will happen after that...
> MC: `(Determined)` I'm ready for whatever is going on here!
* ((According to[[lost tr source]], in the original CN she demands that he stay by her side during the auction, and that's what he's replying 'Deal' to. This localization has MC not asking for help yet, giving her a more assertive personality for the EN market. "Deal" can still be understood to be him confirming that she's passed and he'll hold up his end of the bargain.))

> Sylus: Heh. ...Deal. Don't lose this brooch. It proves you're allowed to come and go in the N109 Zone as you please. `(Looks away and stands.)`
