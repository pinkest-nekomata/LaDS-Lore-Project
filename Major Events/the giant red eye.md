"Outside my window, separated only by glass, a giant eye turns to meet my gaze. [...] The overwhelming darkness of the night envelops the nearby buildings. A storm rages on, swallowing all the light in [[Linkon]]." -- [[MC]], [[01-01.09 Rainfall Curtain]]

"I thought Wanderers had appeared, so I rushed out of my home. Despite scanning the nearby area, I didn't find any abnormal traces of energy fluctuations." -- [[MC]], [[01-02.01 In UNICORNS]]

* The image of the eye shows a circular object with the appearance of an iris and a pupil, red swirls/mist around it. It resembles an eye, but also appears to be robotic.
