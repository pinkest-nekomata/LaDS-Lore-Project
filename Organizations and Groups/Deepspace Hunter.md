This growing profession was a result of the disaster 14 years ago (([[Chronorift Catastrophe]])). Its main goal is to eliminate [[Wanderer]]s, and get their [[Protocore]]s. Hunters typically exhibit physical and mental prowess. Those who are Evolvers sometimes have better combat capabilities. To become a certified Deepspace Hunter, one must take the [[Hunters Association]]'s licensure exam, obtain a license, and adhere to the Hunter's Code.
