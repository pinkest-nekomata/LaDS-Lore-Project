A street within the [[N109 Zone]], and the location of [[Kris's Antiques and Oddities]].

# Name
Given the [[N109 Zone]]'s explicit mafia theming, the name is likely a wink at Omertà:
>  \[...] a [Southern Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy") [code of silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_silence "Code of silence") and code of [honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor "Honor") and [conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct "Code of conduct") that places importance on silence in the face of questioning by authorities or outsiders; non-cooperation with authorities, the government, or outsiders, especially during criminal investigations; and willfully ignoring and generally avoiding interference with the illegal activities of others.
