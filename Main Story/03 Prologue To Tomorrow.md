# Summary
For the two months after the events of [[02 Long Awaited Revelry]], a new Special Operations team (associated with [[Alpha Team]]) has been working on [[Operation Aether Ordeal]] trying to track down more [[Protocore]] smugglers and rumors of another [[Aether Core]]. A series of strange [[Wanderer]] events that involve spatial distortion occur, and the [[Wanderer]]s all have a certain [[Protocurve]] in common, which is named the [[Beta-Protocurve]]. It's confirmed they were modified by an [[Aether Core]], and there are many leads.

The player can choose to complete the three branches in any order:
* [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon]] ([[Zayne]])
* [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]] ([[Rafayel]])
* [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] ([[Xavier]])

Each branch yields a [[Spatium Core]] fragment and a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that had been used to attract [[Wanderer]]s and is confidently tied back to [[Ever]]. Ever then announces a new personal [[Flux Stablizer]] to repel [[Wanderer]]s which presumably uses the same underlying tech as the [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that attracts them.

Analysis shows that one piece of the core is missing, and finding this piece becomes the team's next mission.

After the debrief, [[Jenna]] gives [[MC]] an [[Ever Secret Investigation Report]] which has a clue about the [[Bloomshore District explosion]]. On [[MC]]'s way home, she has a vision of [[the giant red eye]] seeming to devour the city and calling to her, with [[Aether Core]] energy on the other end.

## Commentary
### Timeline
Assuming each branch happens back to back, the minimum amount of time covered is approx 16 days. (See also [[Main Story Timeline]])
* [[03-A Thorns Under the Moon]] includes two 3-day time skips (8 days)
* [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]] includes one 3-day time skip (4 days)
* [[03-C Voyage of the Outcast]] includes one 3-day time skip (4 days)

### Story Structure
All three branches share a few key traits (with the noted exceptions):
* Events
	* A suspicious [[Wanderer]] with a [[Beta-Protocurve]] is identified, then confirmed to be related to the [[Aether Core]].
		* Except for [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]], which is based on a tip about an alleged [[Protocore]] smuggler
	* Three days later, the mission begins in earnest
	* The [[Wanderer]] is described as mutated/modified and has unusual abilities
		* Except for [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]], where the Wanderer is defeated as soon as it's summoned
	* Through spatial anomalies, they're transported into a location (or locations) meaningful to the LI
		* Except for [[03-B Land of Secret Flames]], where the [[blue hole]] serves as an either literal or metaphorical portal to their destination.
	* After defeating the suspicious Wanderer, they gain a fragment of the [[Spatium Core]]
	* They also find a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]], which was used to lure in the [[Wanderer]]s
* Storytelling
	* Each LI wears an outfit from one of their Anecdotes:
		* [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]]
		* [[Xavier - Distant Youth]]
		* [[Rafayel - Phantom of the Siren]]
	* Each story specifically mentions details from all three of each LI's anecdotes (if only briefly) and at least one of the LI's myths:
		* [[Zayne - Foreseer]], [[Tower of Secrets]]
		* [[Xavier - Lightseeker]], [[Shooting Stars]]
		* Rafayel, [[Forgotten Sea]]

### MC's Memory Problems
[[03-01.02 New Discovery]] specifically mentions that [[MC]]'s memory has been acting up since acquiring the [[Aether Core]]. Notably, the [[cosmic cinematic#End of Long Awaited Revelry]] also establishes the idea of the "confluence of the intertwining timelines".

Most importantly, this foreshadows and explains the fragments of memory [[MC]] experiences in these branches from each of the LI's myths.

This setup also gives the writers some freedom for this story's branches. [[MC]] will experience each "reveal" in each branch as if she's seeing them for the first time (so they can be played in any order) and she'll relate to each LI as if they're her main LI (without reference to the others).
