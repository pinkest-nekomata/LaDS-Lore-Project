> "Entering the mansion, my surroundings seem to blur. What captures my attention is the fish tank in the center of the hall. There's no water in it. An odd skeleton sits in the center of the tank, and under the light, it appears dull and pale. Fin-like bones protrude from its pelvis. The skeleton lacks legs, its spine extending like a long string. Its pose is ominously beautiful, resembling a girl sitting cross-legged."

A spiral staircase winds around the cylindrical glass tank. ((This is a central place of honor.))

This is confirmed to be a Lemurian skeleton in [[WU-03 Bouquets and Dirges]], where [[Rafayel]] visits during [[Raymond]]'s funeral and offers flowers to the skeleton instead of to him. Rafayel tells [[Charles]] that the flowers are for a relative's daughter, since he can no longer give them to her.
* ((Given [[K]]'s recent passing, within the last 2-5 years, and the note in [[Siren's Song#02 Stage Manager]] that he's a relative of [[Rafayel]] and [[Talia]]'s, [[K]] is likely her father. Also, since [[K]] asks to be laid to rest ([[Siren's Song#05 One-Man Show]]), his daughter has probably already died by this point. Another supporting piece of evidence is the phrasing "since he can no longer give them to her", implying that [[K]] has offered flowers for his deceased daughter before.))

When MC first notices it, [[Herman]] tells her it's "just art" and to not overthink it.

Neither the [[Hunter's Watch]] nor MC's [[Evol]] can detect any [[Metaflux]] from it. ((This implies that MC initially thinks the strange anatomy might be because it's [[Wanderer]]-related, but it's not.))

# Commentary
It's likely that this [[Lemurian]] entered into [[the pact]] with [[Raymond]] and her ending was not so happy. Her skeleton being on display symbolizes the objectification that [[Lemurian]]s face, especially when people treat them as novelties or pets (See [[Forgotten Sea]] and [[Sea of Golden Sand]])
