# Summary
With the [[Protocore]] submitted for analysis, [[Andrew]] reveals that someone ([[Rafayel]]) has also sent a package with a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that was in the [[blue hole]] and used to summon the [[Wanderer]], and the source is [[Ever]]. The two [[Ever]] reps have gone missing, and Rafayel subtly implies that the died in the [[blue hole]] ((if he didn't outright kill them)).

As MC meets up with [[Rafayel]] to confirm this, he ends up telling her to ask about her [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]] later, if she's going to. It's not a good day for gloomy talk. She now remembers that she had a fever when she was young and lost memories then. ((But we know from [[Josephine's secret notes]] that the real root cause was the [[Aether Core]] experiments on her.))

He mentions thinking about how to "settle the score" but now just earnestly asks her to tell him to forget the grudge. ((Because of their bond, [[the pact]], he would have to.)) She doesn't give him any direct order, but has him promise to tell her if she loses him again.

## Commentary
### Rafayel is willing to kill to defend Lemuria
[[WU-05 Long Lost Treasures]] hints at [[Rafayel]]'s willingness to kill to protect [[Lemuria]]. Though it's not his first choice he doesn't hesitate if it's necessary. It's implied that he made sure the [[Ever]] reps didn't make it back
# Details
Back in [[Linkon]], [[MC]] submits the [[Protocore]] fragment for analysis. [[Andrew]] surprisingly reports they've received a package addressed as coming from her at [[Jewel Reef]]--that she didn't send. Andrew's figured out it was a [[Radio-Frequency Chip]] that had been in [[blue hole]], and it's capable of attracting [[Wanderer]]s. Only [[Ever]] could have created it. But it can't be remotely activated, so it must have been someone at the banquet.

MC deduces that [[Rafayel]] must have sent the device in for her, and goes to talk to him. A news report reveals that many guests went missing, and [[Jewel Reef]] has been sealed off for the investigation. Meanwhile Rafayel sketches an underwater scene.

MC realizes that the missing guests also went into the [[blue hole]], and [[Rafayel]] knows who they are--the ones from [[Ever]]. Rafayel implies that because they willingly went into the blue hole, their fate doesn't matter. He confirms he sent the package.

He also says that if she wants to talk about that "forgotten promise" (see: [[forgotten promise to Rafayel]]) she should pick another day, since it's too sunny and nice for gloomy talk.

She does have a few memories come back.
> During that year, I fell into a deep sleep for three or four days due to a high fever. When I woke up, I lost a lot of memories, and my meeting with Rafayel happened to occur before I got sick.
* ((We know from [[Josephine's secret notes]] that this may not be the true explanation for her memory loss. Or, if it triggered memory loss, it was because her memory was already unstable.))

Rafayel sees her expression and assures her that he knows she wants to say that she forgot a lot from her childhood, but doesn't want it to come off as not wanting to take responsibility. She asks if he's sure he doesn't have telepathy.
> MC: Did you actually go to the beach to wait for me?
> Rafayel: Are you asking about the year after that, or *every* year after that?
> *Observing my expression, Rafayel appears somewhat resigned. Then, he suddenly pokes my forehead.*
> Rafayel: You don't need to feel bad about it. I'm not dumb enough to actually wait for you every year, you know. Buuut I did think about how to settle the score with you.
> MC: ...
> *Rafayel stands up and gently pushes me into a chair. He places my hand on his chest in a half-joking, half-serious manner.*
> Rafayel: The power within the [[Tome of the Sea God]] will protect everything that belongs to the sea. This includes our bond. If you can't let it go, why not just order me now not to hold a grudge over what happened back then?
* ((Okay but like you KNOW he went back to the beach year after year, almost certainly. Fishie liar.))
* ((The nature of their bond (i.e. [[the pact]]) means that if she gave him this sincere order, he would actually have to follow it. It's meaningful that even though MC doesn't know this, she doesn't give him a direct order.))

MC realizes he's sincerely asking and has the chance to either say the power shouldn't be used that way, or lightly tell him that if she loses him again, he'll have to tell her. (She doesn't tell him directly to drop the grudge.)

Outside, it rains into the ocean. MC reflects on how rain will always find its way back to the sea.
