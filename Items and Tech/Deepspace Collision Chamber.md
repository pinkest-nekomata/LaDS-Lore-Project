The place of [[MC]]'s birth, and also several of her deaths.

In 2034, [[Ever]] researchers gained access to a transmission from [[Deepspace]]. After decoding it, they learned of a planet that had discovered an unending power source enabling immortality. ([[Philos]], specifically the [[Shooting Stars]] version.)

In order to try to recreate this energy source, they began collision experiments in this chamber. They succeeded--but shockingly, what appeared was the body of a child about 7 or 8 years old ([[MC]]).

The chamber is capable of absorbing energy to power itself.
