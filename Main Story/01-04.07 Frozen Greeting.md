# Details

[[MC]] wakes up in [[Zayne]]'s office. (She's fallen asleep due to the sleep deprivation mentioned in [[01-04.04 A Real Nightmare]]. It's implied she was dreaming of the flashback in [[01-04.06 Saying Goodbye]].)

Zayne reveals it's 11 pm and he moved MC to his office after trying to wake her three times. She gives an excuse that she's been working on a lot of missions, and Zayne references her discharge instructions as a way to imply she should be taking better care of herself.

MC mentions she's trying to stay busy so she doesn't think of "that day" ([[Bloomshore District explosion]]). Zayne offers a candy and assures her that she should do what she can to cope with her grief. He nudges her that [[Caleb]] and [[Grandma]] would want her to take care of herself.
