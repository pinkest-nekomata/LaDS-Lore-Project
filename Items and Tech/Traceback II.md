# Journey to Earth
The long journey took them through many unfamiliar galaxies, through peaceful cosmic white noise and harrowing turbulence. The journey felt endless, though they passed much of it in hibernation pods. ([[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]]).

There was a mistake in their destination ([[01-08.07 Stellar Guidance]]) though Earth in the Orion galaxy was always the target ([[01-08.10 Trap]], [[cosmic cinematic]]).

 > Something messed with the slipsace during the Backtrack. The spaceship couldn't handle the [[Deepspace Tunnel]] fluctuations. Both she and the [[Aether Core]] vanished without a trace. For all we know, they might already be cosmic dust.

# Crash site
The ship crashed on Earth in a forest. Part of the wreckage is underground. ([[WU-04 From The Stars]])

Eventually, [[Linkon]] City was built nearby, as was a secret signal station, but the ship remained hidden. After the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]], the area became [[No-Hunt Zone 7]], which features heavily in the main story chapter [[01-03 Talented Hunter]]. ((The descriptions of the no-hunt zone and of the forest in [[WU-04 From The Stars#03 Waterfall Inside Forest]] clearly parallel one another, especially the signal station.))

# Theories

## 214 years
Notably, [[Xavier]] first meets [[Academy MC]] 214 years after Earth was reborn as [[Philos]]. Conspicuously, [[Xavier's Trailer]] mentions that it's his 214th spring on Earth, and will be his last. The repeat of this number, combined with the "mistake" in the mission's journey, can't be coincidence.

It's possible that the [[Backtrackers]] were aiming for year 214 (214 years *after* Earth became Philos) in order to find [[Academy MC]]. But instead they landed at year *negative* 214, that is, 214 years *before* Earth became [[Philos]]. This implies that during the main story timeline, Earth is about to become Philos--and since it's been a year since the game's launch (Written in Fev 2025), that event would be happening pretty darn soon. So, TBD.

One complicating aspect to this theory is the [[Zayne - Dawnbreaker]] timeline ([[Still In Dark]]). Characters mention that [[Wanderer]]s have been around for the past approx 50+ years. Nothing specifically confirms or disconfirms if these events could happen after the creation of [[Philos]], though there's no reference to Plates or immortality. It could be an alternate timeline where [[Philos]] isn't made, where it's made later, where the [[Wanderer]]s appeared earlier than 2034, etc. Definitely some [[spacetime]] shenanigans here.
