> "The locals have already forgotten when Philo, a flower shop, first appeared on a street corner. Tiny, blue, star-shaped flowers cascade from the third-floor balcony and envelop nearby buildings. The owner seems to have mysterious friends. On nights with little moonlight, one can often see starlight surrounding the backyard like fireflies."

[[Jeremiah]]'s flower shop. The name is a reference to [[Philos]], where he and the rest of the [[Backtrackers]] came from.
