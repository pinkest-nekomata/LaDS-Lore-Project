[[Zayne]]'s branch in [[03 Prologue To Tomorrow]] to locate a [[Spatium Core]] fragment.

# Summary
Zayne has a recurring nightmare of being in a dim hospital, chasing "the girl". ((We can infer it's [[MC]].)) The walls erupt with [[black crystals]] that then impale her.

Back at the hospital, [[MC]] tries to get [[Zayne]] to take his insomnia seriously. He hasn't slept well since he returned from the [[Arctic]] trip of [[01-05 Eternal Aurora]]--or perhaps since she gave him the [[Wanderer crystal sample]] to analyze.

On the way to dinner, [[Jenna]] calls with a lead on a new [[Beta-Protocurve]] location. [[Zayne]] offers to drive MC.

## Commentary
We can expect this nightmare and clues here to build on [[Zayne's Dawnbreaker dreams]], and [[Zayne losing control of his Evol]] and his fears of hurting MC.

# Details

[[Zayne]] has a nightmare. See also [[Zayne's Dawnbreaker dreams]].
> *The sound of footsteps reverberates, a hollow echo upon the marble floor. Looking up, Zayne once again sees that familiar silhouette of the girl.*
> *In the quiet hospital corridor, its walls grayish-blue and dimly lit by incandescent lights, only the girl stands bright and resolute.*
> Zayne: `(Shaky breath)`
> *Yearning to call out to her yet incapable of making a sound, he has no choice but to quicken his pace. He runs after her. Yet at that moment, terrifying [[black crystals]] erupt from the surrounding walls.*
> Zayne: No... Stop...!
> *Without warning, the entire space distorts. Those sharp spikes hurtle toward the girl's throat.
> Panicking, she turns to face him. As their eyes meeet, her lips quiver in despair, softly whispering broken, desperate sounds.*
> Girl: Zayne... Zayne!

> `The scene changes to Zayne dozing off.`
> MC: Zayne, Zayne?

Zayne has been napping in a sleeping pod. MC asks if he had another nightmare.
> Zayne: Yes...

He tells her not to worry, teasing her that it's a good sign he can't sleep well with her staring at him. She reveals that ever since he returned from [[Mt Eternal]] two months ago ((the trip in [[01-05 Eternal Aurora]])) he's been sleeping poorly and claiming nightmares are to blame. He won't discuss what happened in the [[Arctic]], but did share the recurring "nightmare" with her.

She reminds him he has a business trip coming up, and he might collapse. He says that even if he does, another doctor will take his place. She presses a finger against his lips as a warning.
> MC: No matter how many other doctors there are, they're for other people. My doctor is right here in front of me.
> Zayne: `(smiling softly)` Alright, I'll be careful and stay alive.

MC guesses that [[Zayne]] started having nightmares after she gave him the [[Wanderer crystal sample]] from the [[human-like Wanderer]]s she collected in [[02-02.05 Nightmare Finale]].

He insists it's a coincidence, then reports progress on the crystal analysis. MC wants to know if it's related to [[Protocore Syndrome]]. He'll tell her once the results are conclusive.

They head out of the hospital, MC expressing concern for Zayne's insomnia, which he brushes off. She's been trying to send him sleep aids. He teases her, then agrees that as her one and only doctor, he should listen to her.

MC gets a call via her [[Hunter's Watch]]--Jenna has a report on hew [[Beta-Protocurve]] activity. The update might disrupt her dinner plans with Zayne. Zayne offers to drive her in.
