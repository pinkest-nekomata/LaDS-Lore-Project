# Summary
[[MC]] heads to [[Skyhaven]] on an unofficial basis, impersonating a [[Farspace Fleet]] officer to investigate the suspicious [[Cascade District explosion]]. One child ([[Mia]]) is in the hospital, her twin brother ([[Kevi]]) is missing, and [[Kevi and Mia's parents]] are "unavailable". ([[04-01.01 Infiltration]])

While investigating, [[MC]] is suddenly summoned to the landing pad to receive the new [[Farspace Fleet]] [[Colonel]]--who turns out to be [[Caleb]]. Caleb's handling of a rogue officer, [[Joseph]], casts suspicion on the [[Farspace Fleet]] for manipulating officers, potentially with [[Cybezin]]. [[Caleb]] immediately notices [[MC]] is an "imposter" and brings her in for interrogation. ([[04-01.02 Above the Clouds]])

During the interrogation, [[Caleb]]'s cold words seem to have double meanings, and [[MC]] eventually "passes" the interrogation by resolutely lying about her reason for being there. Caleb suddenly warms and welcomes her, teasing her for not recognizing him. ([[04-01.03 Empathic Interrogation]]) They head over to [[Caleb's place]] and he cooks her dinner while she makes plans for her investigation. ([[04-01.04 Gentle Gaze]])

The next day, she heads over to [[Willow Medical Center]] to meet [[Mia]], and runs into [[Zayne]] who helps her out. Her time with [[Mia]] is cut short by the [[Farspace Fleet]] butting in, though she gets a stuffed dog [[Lucia]] that has a voice recording of the twins with a clue. ([[04-01.05 Visitation]])

MC heads back to the site of the explosion, using [[Lucia]] to lure [[Kevi]] out from his hiding place--a pocket dimension created by the [[Spatium Core]] fragment that [[Kevi and Mia's parents]] gave him to use, telling him not to trust the [[Farspace Fleet]]. ([[04-01.06 Veiled Sanctuary]]) MC immediately calls Zayne, and they come up with a plan to get the kids off of [[Skyhaven]] and away from the Fleet.

As MC goes to check in with [[Caleb]], [[Viper]] confronts her ([[04-01.07 Unexpected]]) leading to an altercation when Caleb arrives ([[04-01.08 Battle - Snake Trap]]) which culminates in Caleb chasing Viper down and then lying, saying he couldn't find him. They head home for the night. ([[04-01.09 Blindfold]])

The next day, [[MC]] searches for an opening to sneak away so she can return to [[Kevi]] and get him to [[Zayne]]. However, she seems to be coming down with something from the rain the day before, and [[Caleb]] appears to use this as an excuse to give her sleeping pills to keep her from leaving while he's gone that night. Skyhaven is on complete lockdown due to the impending "clean-up" that the [[Farspace Fleet]] is performing. ([[04-01.10 Heart's Crossing]])
