# Quotes
> Zayne: Is it possible to make a wish without cake and candles?

> Zayne: Indeed, they are common, everyday things in life... However, when the world is about to end, even they become precious. So they are the things I want to do the most. In other words... If a meteor actually hits Earth, I can't think of a better way to spend my last moments.

> Zayne: However, perhaps we... We can still do one more thing.

> *At the very last moment, he silently kisses me on the lips. A quick, fleeting peck. Yet it had been planned for a long time. Everthing is quiet, but I can hear flames erupting in my heart.*

> Zayne: And if there's one more thing I'd like to do, then...
> *He kisses me again, more passionately this time.*
> Zayne: It's done.

> Zayne: We've only just started getting used to a new, common everyday thing.
