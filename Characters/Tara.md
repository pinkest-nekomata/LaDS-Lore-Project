Rookie from [[MC]]'s class of hunters.

Sector: Data Analysis
Captain: [[Andrew]]

Loves tarot. Admires [[Jenna]], especially after Jenna saved her life "over a decade ago" ((possibly during the [[Chronorift Catastrophe]])). This inspired Tara to become a hunter.

# Spacepedia
The first colleague I befriended after becoming a hunter. Young with a cute personality that suits her name. Aside from being in the know on interesting gossip and info, she really likes divination and the occult. Not only is she a true friend, but also a trustworthy teammate.

# Trivia
* In [[Plushie Go Go]], Tara's status on MC's phone is "UNICORNS girls go go go!"
