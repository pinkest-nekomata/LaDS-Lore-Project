# Summary
MC remarks that if he treats her like a pet cat, he shouldn't be surprised to get scratched. She decides to try killing him just to see how hard it'll be. After all, she was raised as the princess of the Ivory City to become a dragon-killing weapon.

In the Abyssal Mark Kindled scene, she attempts to stab him twice. He easily stops her, grappling her and holding her from behind. He bites the base of her neck, saying that before the mark fades, she'll have two more chances to kill him. "Prove to me that you can be stronger."

MC sets her sights on getting out of the top of the cave. It takes her five days, but she finally reaches the top. There's a view of [[Tarus]] and it seems like another dead end, but there's a series of columns like vertebrae leading out over the chasm. Just as she's going to jump, Sylus arrives.

She insists that her revenge isn't done until she's killed the [[Judicator's Oracle]] that condemned her--but Sylus reveals he's already dead. She and Sylus had destroyed one Sanctuary, but the humans declared a Doomsday prophecy and destroyed the entirety of [[Ivory City]]. He shares his memory of the carnage.

She shoves him away--but falls from the cliff in the process. Finally showing his worry, he dives and catches her.

It rains for three days. Sylus comforts her by releasing a mountain cat into the cave. Once the rain stops, she sits on top of the mountain and looks out over Tarus, singing a [[requiem]]. He hears only a bit of it, and asks her to sing it again. She dodges the question and they talk about her backstory. Ultimately, she agrees to sing again if he can get her a pipe organ.

Finally, she gives him a name, selecting something that sounds similar to the ancient language. Sylus.


## Commentary

# Details

> That night, the dragon places me with all the treasures he gathered. It's as if I'm one of them.
> It appears like everything is present, but all I can grasp is the moonlight descending into the lair from an opening.
> Whenever I close my eyes, the sound of howling wind inside the cave sends me back to that blood-red valley. All I can hear is a dragon's cries.
> The moment those blades pierce his chest, the same pain and fury also run through me.
> Perhaps... a fragment of the dragon's soul truly did enter my body the moment I pulled out the sword.
> At the time, I didn't understand the implications.
> I also didn't know this would mark the start of a curse.

> Day 2
> *As dawn arrives, I like on a pile of gold, squinting at the lackluster jewels. I was twirling the [[Fiendbane]] in my hand for the third time.*

MC reasons that if he's just fattening her up before killing her, then in order to live she needs to strike first, going after the source of his power--his eye. He won't outright kill her, because he wants her soul. So, she decides to test the waters and see how hard it'll be.

> MC: (Besides... if he's going to treat me like a pet cat, he shouldn't be surprised if he gets scratched.)

The staircase wraps around the broken central pillar. She proceeds down to where the dragon rests, at the bottom of the stairs.

**Abyssal Mark Kindled scene:**
The dragon reclines on a platform, surrounded by piles of gold and treasures. A necklace dangles off the tip of his tail. Bored, he lifts a golden lamp and examines it.

MC tries to stab him with the [[Fiendbane]], but he easily grabs her with his tail, pulling her onto the platform next to him.

> MC: Tch, I knew it.
> Dragon: Your footsteps are noisy. And you breathe heavily.
* ((He also tells her she's breathing too loudly in [[02-02.04 The First Deal]]))
> `He grabs her wrist.`
> Dragon: Consider yourself lucky. At the moment, I'm bored to tears.
> MC: You'd be a fool to think I only brought one dagger!
> `She stabs at his neck with her left hand. He grabs her other wrist, pinning her onto the platform.`
> MC: You...!
> Dragon: Child's play. I admit you're clever at times. Yet your skills leave much to be desired. `(He strokes her cheek with the back of his hand.)` If you still have tricks, now is the time to use them, mortal. I could use a stretch.
> `MC pretends to soften, stroking his chest.`
> MC: I don't have anything else... I was just bored and wanted to play around. You'll let me go, yes?
> `He takes her hand in his, guiding it up his chest to the base of his neck.`
> Dragon: Before you tried to kill me, did you consider that it'd end like this?
> `She reaches for his throat to strangle him, but he easily grapples her and turns her around, holding her from behind. He grips her throat.`
> Dragon: I see. Your overconfidence truly led you to believe I'd be merciful.
> `His grip moves up to her jaw, and he speaks into her ear.`
* ((Note the callback in [[Innocent Birdcage]]))
> Dragon: Feel your heartbeat right now. `(His tail moves up towards her.)` Dont forget if I apply more pressure at this very spot... Your heart will never beat again. `(His tail snakes around her from between his legs.)`
> Dragon: Are you going to stay this weak forever? `(Inhales)` This will be the mark for the first time.
> `He bites the base of her neck, leaving an outline of the bite. He brushes the mark with the back of his hand.`
> Dragon: Until this mark disappears, you will have two more chances to take my life. Prove to me that you can be stronger.

> My first hunt ends with me being branded with a mark from the dragon.
> Aside from the dragon who resides in the cave's depths, there's also the cave's opening where the light pours in--that's another challenge to overcome.
> Even if the dragon has no interest in hurting me at the moment, I can't let myself stay trapped in this gilded cage with no way out.
> I tear apart the golden silk carpets form the dragon's lair and weave them into a rope. Using his collection of weapons, I carve footholds into the wall.
> I throw the rope up again and again. With every fall and every fresh wound, the gap between me and freedom grows a little smaller.
> The dragon knows about my escape pan. Sometimes, he even sits on the pile of gold, resting his head in his hands as he watches--
> He neither helps nor stops me. It takes me a while to realize he isn't just watching--he's studying me out of sheer boredom.
> Just like I used to watch a cat in the Sanctuary that kept trying to jump over a wall it could never clear.

Five days later, MC finally reaches the top and the view of [[Tarus]] City. But it's another dead end. The bottomless Abyss lies between the mountain and the city.
> An endless crimson mountain range, covered with forests that are void of life with their scorched trees, surrounds the lonely city. There is no other path.

Behind her, a mountain ridge snakes down like a dragon's spine. "Between the vertebrae lies a vast, yawning chasm." Later, the dragon refers to these "twenty one bones"--the path is formed of pillars rising from the chasm. She prepares to sprint and leap. With a flap of wings, the dragon lands behind her.
> Dragon: You'll die if you can't make the jump.
> MC: You won't let me die. Or else you won't be able to have my soul. However, you're not concerned about me running away.
> Dragon: If you can go down without dying, then you may come and go as you please. I'm also curious to see where a "sorceress" who consorts with a fiend thinks she can go.
> *With his arms crossed, he floats in front of me. I shoot a glance at his dragon horns and tail.*
> MC: You're skilled in flapping your mouth to annoy people.
> Dragon: Thank you. It's one of my few strengths.

MC insists that since she hasn't found the [[Judicator's Oracle]] that condemned her, her revenge isn't complete. He tells her not to bother--even if she can "leap down these twenty-one bones", nobody will be waiting for her. She asks what he means, and he tosses a bloody bag at her feet.
> Dragon: Eyes. Crows pecked out the eyes of the person you're looking for.

MC correctly guesses it's not the dragon's doing.
> Dragon: You had me destroy a [[Sanctuary]], but the [[Legion of Justitia]] took it further--they wiped out an entire city under the pretense that "Doomsday is nigh."

The dragon's eye activates, and he calls the city a "burning purgatory", offering to take her there.
> At the highest point of the dragon's ridge, crimson clouds surge upward. I'm swept into a boundless sea of roaring flames.

There's a moment of vertigo, then she sees his memory through the piece of his soul, and the burning chaos and fighting.
> Dragon: Humans don't need fiends. Their own fear is enough to bring about the world's end.

Then, she's falling.
> My soul trembles in pure ecstasy as I soar through the roaring flames. I pay little attention to the warm droplets that splash my eyes.

Angry, she pushes him away and ends the vision--then she slips and falls for real.
> The dragon's expression changes from cruel amusement to alarm as he spreads his wings. He flies toward me. The air no longer moves when a scorching embrace envelops me. The descent doesn't stop. It's as if I'm being held in a safe cocoon.

> The day the dragon and I destroyed the Sanctuary, the war of Doomsday began.
> I never imagined that the peace sustained for over 1600 years could be broken so easily.

It rains for three consecutive days. In the lair, a small mountain cat comes to play with her--and later she realizes it couldn't have made it there on its own. Was he comforting her?

She sits atop the mountain, looking at Tarus and reflecting on its contrast to Ivory City. It's supposedly full of chaos and evil, where those shunned by others gather.

The dragon lands near her.
> Dragon: What's that sound?

She finishes the last note, then gazes at Tarus.
> MC: A requiem for the departed.
> Dragon: Sing it again.
> MC: Haven't you ever heard someone sing before?
> Dragon: I've... never heard *you* sing.

He sits next to her, tail curing behind her.
> The nights in Tarus City are always brightly lit. Unlike the flames of war in the Ivory City, desires and revelry burn.
> Dragon: I've heard you're the princess of Ivory City.
> *I manage a stiff smile.*
> MC: I was supposed to be a weapon to slay dragons. They told me I could kill a dragon--so they filled my head with a lot of things about them. But when they decided to execute me, they said I *was* a dragon.
> Dragon: That's how humans are. They fear those who are different. [...] Why can't you leave that place behind?
> *I shield a flickering white candle in front of me, its flame about to go out.*
> MC: It's not that. I just lived there for a long time.
> Dragon: Ah. You consider that place your "home."
> MC: ...Maybe I just missed the cats, dogs, and birds there.
> Dragon: Face it. No matter how much you hate it or want to leave, a home is still a part of your soul. The more you try to excise it, the more you'll be reminded of who you are.
> *When I don't respond, he changes the conversation to the topic of my supposed crimes.*
> Dragon: Enlighten me. What do you and dragons have in common?
> MC: ...We have nothing in common. I just broke the rules by keeping a golden lamp with an engraved dragon. Aside from the one in *The Fiend-Slaying God*, no dragons are allowed in the Sanctuary. But I could only talk to that little dragon. And one day, they caught me talking to it.
> *Even now, I can't help but laugh when I remember the [[Judicator's Oracle]]''s expression upon seeing that obsidian dragon coiled around the lamp.*
> MC: To think a carefully trained, dragon-slaying weapon would cherish a dragon instead. The [[Judicator's Oracle]] looked like he had been attacked by a dragon. Hysteric, he ordered me to destroy my dragon. I know it's just an object. Destroying it would be easy.
> *I remember clutching the little dragon as I as forced into a corner. The shadows of the crowd engulfed me like a tide.*
> MC: ...But I didn't want to listen to them that day.

> The essence of the Ivory City is reflected in its citizens. People dress nicely, exude grace, and possess untainted souls.
> The [[Judicator's Oracle]] says desire is the seed of calamity. Excessive indulgence will allow this disease to grow quietly.
> So, I had to act like everyone else. I needed to abide by proper etiquette, say the right words, and bind my hands and feet with invisible white threads. All of these things turned me into a puppet without a heart.
> But... they still burned my dragon.
> To kill my dragon, they framed me for a great crime. They sentenced a puppet to death because it had one desire.

> MC: Since they've branded me a "sorceress"... fine, then. How could i not do what a sorceress is supposed to do? [...] Since they destroyed what's most precious to me, it's only fair that they surrender what's most precious to them. Everyone wearing a sacred robe should have their chest split open to see their truest selves.
> *The threads binding me are cut away, one by one. I tighten my fist and finally see what's wrapped inside--a heart still beating.*
> MC: Revenge and plunder. That's what I desire. If you can make it happen, my soul is yours.
> *The night grows colder, and the candle finally flickers out. The dragon doesn't respond to my deal. He just leans in closer.*
> Dragon: Do you know what you look like right now?
> MC: Hmm?
> Dragon: You're a young dragon who just grew her horns.
> *Upon imagining this, I lower my head and start laughing. Maybe he's right. With my little dragon gone, horns grew in my heart.*
> Dragon: Growing dragon horns symbolizes rebirth. It's a good thing.
> MC: What about you? How did it feel when you grew your horns?
> Dragon: It was... nothing special. 
> *The dragon sits back down, avoiding my gaze.*
> Dragon: It just hurt a bit.
> MC: Then are you a dragon or a human?
> *Maybe he doesn't hear me--or maybe he just ignores it. He lets out a chuckle.*
> MC: ...I know my request can be considered unreasonable. It's fine if you can't do it.
> Dragon: Even if your desire is to resurrect the people of the Ivory City, it's still within my capabilities. 
> MC: Is this a fiend's act of kindness?
> Dragon: People are far more interesting alive than dead. If you truly want revenge, the best way is to keep them alive. Or would you say this world is the closest thing to hell itself? You can only feel pain when you're alive.
* ((Note the foreshadowing.))
> *His expression is malicious as he speaks, but his eyes sparkle like gemstones. I recall the dragon in the valley with a sword in its chest.*
> MC: Is this the wisdom you've learned as a dragon?
> Dragon: You faced death before. You should know the answer.
> MC: Do you think you'll devour my soul first? Or will I pluck out your eye first?
> *The dragon ignores my mischievous question and looks beyond Tarus City.*
> Dragon: Sing that song again.
> *I know our conversation is brought to a close.*
> MC: It's boring without music. It sounds better with an organ accompaniment. Can you get one for me?
> Dragon: It's a simple matter. Consider it done.
> *He gets up to leave, and I grab hold of his tail.*
> MC: Hey, do you have a name?
> Dragon: Does it matter?
> MC: You can't eat me for now, and I won't be leaving anytime soon. Looks like we'll be stuck with each other for a while. What should I call you? Demon? Dragon? Or maybe.. Drago?
> *The Fiend gives me a cold stare. Sensing his boredom, I shut my mouth, but then I hear two faint syllables rumble from his throat.*
> MC: ..."Stayrus"? Or are you telling me to stay clear? 
> Dragon: It's an ancient Philosian word. Since you can't read it, you probably won't understand it.
> MC: How about I call you by a name that sounds similar? Is Sylus alright with you?
> Dragon: Call me whatever you want. But don't expect me to respond.
> *The dragon rises, and his unseen wings stir up small gusts around him.*
> MC: Where are you going, Sylus?
> *He takes a half step back and falls off the cliff.*
> Dragon: I'll be resting.

> On the night that I learn the dragon's name, I see him again in my dream.
> He falls into the valley as soldiers from the [[Legion of Justitia]] thrust their weapons into his chest.
> He slides down, and sharp rocks tear into his flesh. A dragon's roar fills the valley, then slowly fades into silence.
> But at the bottom of the valley, it's not a dragon lying there. It's a young man, barely clinging to life.
