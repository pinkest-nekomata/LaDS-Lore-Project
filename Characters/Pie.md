"Int his cold, soulless world where advanced technology reigns supreme, it's surprising to see gluttonous creatures like you." -- [[MC]] to Pie, [[01-05.06 Enigmatic Guide]]

"When [[Dr. Noah]] adopted him, he ate six pies in one go." -- [[Zayne]], [[01-05.06 Enigmatic Guide]]

[[Dr. Noah]] rescued a small white fox from [[Mt Eternal]]. Pie's intelligence is equivalent to that of a nine-year-old child. He has an exceptional appetite and is adept at acting cute to get food. It's a tactic that never fails. His name is Pie because he devoured six meat pies in one sitting when rescued.
